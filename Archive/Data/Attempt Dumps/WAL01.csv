1,100,1,1,"PASS","Testing comments... I did very well!","binary data"
2,100,2,1,"PASS","The statement coverage of line 9 was about the final position of a piece. The x coordinate had to be either lower than 0 or higher than 7 and the same for the y coordinate. The board has 7 rows and 7 columns so in order to adhere to the conditions, one would have to set a piece outside of the bounds. To complete the statement coverage I picked a piece from the board and moved it out of bounds to (-1, -1).","binary data"
3,200,2,2,"PASS","The statement had a ""||"" (or sign) so one had to make sure that it was possible to reach both True and False. To be True, the destination of the piece that one moves has to be out of bounds (x coordinate lower than 0 or higher than 7 and same for y coordinate - since the board is 7 by 7, it has to be out of bounds), so that's what I did. To be False, one just needs to make sure the piece is moved to a position inside of the board.","binary data"
5,250,2,26,"PASS","To do condition coverage, it's necessary to cover all outcomes so have a True and a False outcome. I put one piece for both blue and red so I had 13 pieces on the board which made the condition have a True outcome and I also had 12 pieces on the board for both red and blue, so it gave a False outcome.","binary data"
6,250,2,25,"PASS","I did condition coverage so I made sure that I got 2 different outcomes: True and False. To get True, I added a piece of both colors to the board so I had 13 blue pieces and 13 red pieces. And to get False, I didn't touch the board, made sure I had 12 pieces of each (so not above 12).","binary data"
7,300,2,22,"PASS","The statement is bluePieces > 12 || redPieces > 12. I did the 3 test cases, one where both were false so I had 12 pieces of each color on the board. The other test case I had 12 blue pieces on the board and 13 red pieces on the board so it was False || True. And the final test case I had 12 red pieces and 13 blue pieces, so True || False","binary data"
