1,100,1,1,"PASS","Testing comments... I did very well!","binary data"
2,100,2,1,"PASS","I had to do place a piece beyond the board, so that the condition would be False.","binary data"
3,200,2,2,"PASS","I did one test beyond the board and another inside, so that there was a test for the condition to be True or False.","binary data"
4,250,2,26,"PASS","I had to do 2 tests so that each part of the conditional had a chance to be True and False.","binary data"
5,250,2,25,"PASS","I did two where i added 2 pieces in one and no pieces in the other, so that each part of the condition had chance to be True and False and so that the entire conditional could also be both True and False.","binary data"
6,300,2,22,"PASS","I did 3 tests where the left and right sides were, respectively, FF, FT, and TF, so that both sides were True and False at some time, there could be a final decision of True and False too, and i honestly don't know how to explain the other part","binary data"
7,0,2,3,"FAIL","I found a bug, I think. So, in the first test I placed a piece (a red piece just to say everything) on the out of bonds spot with -2, 2. I moved to the second test and place another red piece in the out bounds with 3, -3. However, when I went back to the 1st test, it showed the piece on 3, -3 instead of the original spot, though the rest of the board was okay.","binary data"
8,100,2,4,"PASS","I did a non-diagonal move so that the line difference was -1 and the column one was 0, thus different","binary data"
9,200,2,5,"PASS","I did a diagonal and a non diagonal move so that the condition would be True and False, respectively.","binary data"
10,150,2,6,"PASS","I did a diagonal move just one square over, so that the condition on 15 would be False, and it passed to the condition on 18 and made it True","binary data"
11,150,2,7,"PASS","I did a regular diagonal move that was to an empty square so that it would fulfill the condition","binary data"
12,150,2,8,"PASS","I did a diagonal move 2 squares over, as if i was capturing, so that the condition would be fulfilled","binary data"
13,350,2,9,"PASS","I did 2 diagonal moves, one with 1 square and the other with 2 squares, so that the condition would be True the first time and False the second","binary data"
14,175,2,10,"PASS","I did a diagonal move to an empty square, so that the previous condition would be true and it would reach the return statement","binary data"
15,175,2,11,"PASS","I did a diagonal move into a space with another piece, so that the if condition would be false and thus reach the return statement","binary data"
16,250,2,12,"PASS","I did one test where there was a diagonal move to an empty spot and another to a spot where there was a piece, so that the condition had a chance to be True and False. ","binary data"
17,175,2,13,"PASS","I did a diagonal move of 2 squares, where the end spot was empty, to fulfill the conditions before and reach the statement","binary data"
18,175,2,14,"PASS","I did a diagonal move over 2 squares as if i was capturing one piece of the same colour, so the condition on the previous line could be true and reach the return statement","binary data"
19,225,2,15,"PASS","I made a move as if I was capturing a piece of the opposing colour so that it would make the line 27 condition false and the line 29 condition true and reach the return statement","binary data"
20,225,2,16,"PASS","I did 2 diagonal moves over 2 squares capturing in one a piece of the same colour and in the other of the opposite colour so that the condition would be False first and True after","binary data"
21,175,2,17,"PASS","I did a diagonal move of 2 squares to a line with a piece already there, so the if condition would be false and thus reach the return statement","binary data"
22,175,2,18,"PASS","I did 2 diagonal moves over 2 squares, one to an empty spot and another to a filled spot so the condition could be both True and False.","binary data"
23,100,2,19,"PASS","I added an extra piece so the condition would be true and reach the return statement","binary data"
24,100,2,20,"PASS","I removed all the red pieces and added an extra blue one, so that the first condition would be false and the second true and reach the return statement.","binary data"
25,200,2,21,"PASS","I did a test without doing anything and another adding a piece, so that the condition could be False and True ","binary data"
26,300,2,23,"PASS","This was my 2nd attempt and I tried all combinations of the two sides of the condition so that both sides each got a chance to be True and False, and to show the True and False of each condition implicated the result, using the False as the neutral opperator","binary data"
