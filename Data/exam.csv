"Carimbo de data/hora","Please provide your code, as specified in Questionnaire 1 (e.g. LJD24).","Can a statement coverage challenge ever ask you for more than one test case?","Succinctly explain your answer to the previous question.","Study the following code snippet before answering this question. What is the minimum number of test cases needed to achieve 100% decision coverage of line 1?","Study the following code snippet before answering the following question. What is the minimum number of test cases needed to achieve 100% condition coverage in line 3?","Study the previous question's code snippet and the following table before answering the following question.

"2024/03/14 5:36:28 da tarde GMT","5l4yy","No","We just need the line to be ran once. Therefore, a single test case will suffice.","2","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:36:32 da tarde GMT","COD00","No","You just need to make the state so that the line is executed, only one test is needed to craft that environment","2","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:37:53 da tarde GMT","WAL01","No","To pass a statement coverage challenge, the statement has to executed at least once, which is possible with a single test case.","2","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:37:54 da tarde GMT","SHU23","Yes","It depends. If we just need to cover one line, no, but multiple lines might need multiple test cases to be covered.","2","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:38:12 da tarde GMT","DLF19","No","A statement coverage challenge only needs me to reach a certain statement, so I won't have to test different conditions, even if there are many","2","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:38:29 da tarde GMT","MSB67","No","If the goal of the statement coverage challenge is to make the code execution reach a specific line of the code, it is only going to be needed to have one test case that reaches that line to satisfy that condition.","2","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:40:04 da tarde GMT","LVX19","No","Statement coverage simply requires you to test the line statement at least once.","3","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:41:41 da tarde GMT","VSH04","No","Since we are covering just the statement asked during the challenge, one test case is enough. On the other hand, if there are more than one statement to cover, it may requires more than a single test case","3","3, because there are three determinant test cases.","{1, 2, 3, 4}"
"2024/03/14 5:44:46 da tarde GMT","RDJ29","No","A statement coverage challenge just tests if the code execution reached that line. So, just one test case is enough, when the criteria for the line to be executed is met","2","2, because the condition must be covered for cases True and False.","{2, 3, 4}"
