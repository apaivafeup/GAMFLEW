1,100,1,1,"PASS","Testing comments... I did very well!","binary data"
2,100,2,1,"PASS","I had to find a way for the flow of the execution to reach line 9 to ensure statement coverage. Because the full condition was one with all OR's I only had to ensure one of the conditions was true for it to enter the if and reach line 9.
So, I move a piece to a place outside the board, namely -1 in the x coords and 0 in y coords.","binary data"
3,200,2,2,"PASS","I had to make two test cases to ensure decision coverage of lines 7-8 (the decision being true and false). The first test case I did was to cover the possibility of the decision being true, this was made by providing a valid move of the piece. The second test case was to cover the decision being false, which I was able to do by moving the piece ""out of bounds"" to x: -1 and y: 0.","binary data"
4,250,2,26,"PASS","I had to test whether the outcome was true or false to ensure condition coverage. To achieve that, test case 1 is for both conditions to be false with only 12 blue and 12 red pieces on the board and test case 2 is for both conditions to be true with 13 pieces of each color in the board.","binary data"
5,0,2,25,"FAIL","I'm still trying to understand condition/decision coverage better. I will review it a bit before making a new attempt.","binary data"
6,250,2,25,"PASS","To test condition/decision coverage I had to test each condition being true and false at least once and the outcome being true and false once as well. To do that, I did my first attempt with 12 blue and 12 red pieces, covering the false for each condition and the false for the outcome. In my second attempt I had 13 red and 13 blue pieces to cover the true for both conditions and the true for the outcome as well.","binary data"
7,0,2,22,"FAIL","To test mc/dc I tried to test the case of both conditions being true, condition A being false and B true and then both being false. I'm not sure why it didn't work, but I'll review the concepts and try once again.","binary data"
8,300,2,22,"PASS","After reviewing the meaning of MC/DC, I understood that I needed to test the following conditions (A being bluePieces > 12 and B being redPieces > 12): A is True, B is False; A is False, B is True and A is False, B is False. This allowed me to test the influence of the A condition in the outcome (when keeping B as False) and the influence of the B condition (when keeping A as False). 
To achieve that, test 1 was for true + false (13 blue pieces and 12 red ones); test 2 was for false + true (12 blue and 13 red), and test 3 was for false + false (12 blue and 12 red).","binary data"
9,100,2,4,"PASS","To make the statement true, I simply moved the pieces in a way that the line difference would be 2 and the column difference 0, making them different from each other and allowing the code to reach line 16.","binary data"
10,150,2,6,"PASS","The condition I need to ensure is false is the one in line 15. After making a move in which the line and column difference are the same (in my case equal to 1), it allows the code to reach line 18, therefore achieving statement coverage on line 18.","binary data"
11,100,2,19,"PASS","To achieve statement coverage on line 6, I had to make sure that the condition in line 5 was evaluated to be true, which I was able to do by making the board have 13 blue pieces and 12 red ones. As it is an OR condition, if one of the statements evaluates to true, the whole condition is true, allowing the code to reach line 6.","binary data"
12,150,2,30,"PASS","To ensure the coverage of line 16, I had to place the piece in a position in which the x was not an even number. To do so, I placed a piece in x = 1 and y = 4. The condition in line 16 would then evaluate to true because the odd list would not include 4 (the new value of y).","binary data"
