1,100,1,1,"PASS","Testing comments... I did very well!","binary data"
2,100,2,1,"PASS","The objective was to check if the final state of a piece was 'out-of-bounds.' To accomplish that, I moved a piece at the top left of the board to the 'out-of-bounds' area.","binary data"
3,200,2,2,"PASS","The objective was to check whether the last moved piece was out of bounds by checking the true and false alternatives for the boolean expression in lines 7-8. For the true alternative, I placed the piece in the 'out-of-bounds' box (as I did in Challenge 1.1). For the false alternative, I moved a red piece within the board limits ","binary data"
4,0,2,26,"FAIL","I only added one red piece to the total of red pieces for the first test case, checking the false and the true values for the two conditions of line 5 (in order). Then for the second I added only one blue piece to the total of blue pieces, testing the opposite","binary data"
5,250,2,26,"PASS","The objective was to determine whether the board's total number of pieces was higher than the initial number. Therefore, I checked when the number of red or blue pieces was higher than the initial number (12) and the opposite, i.e., when there were less than the initial number for both colors. This allowed to test in only 2 test cases the truth value of both conditions","binary data"
6,250,2,25,"PASS","The aim was to test whether the board had more pieces than the initial ones or less for both colors. The resolution was the same as the one I did for challenge 2.8","binary data"
7,300,2,22,"PASS","The objective was to check if the number of pieces of both colors was the same as the initial one, if only the number of blue pieces was higher, and if only the number of red pieces was higher","binary data"
