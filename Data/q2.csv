Adding and removing checkers through multiple clicks of the add button doesn't seem very intuitive at start. Can adapt just fine though.
Otherwise, great work."

When testing the login page in dark mode, the ""small"" letters that provided context to the username and password inputs were not visible (maybe they should change to white like in other screens).
The dropdown of the Auxiliary Functions tab in the ""How to Play"" page was not working for me, and it was always showing the ""isTriangle"" function.
At last, I feel like it would be nice to have a ""go back arrow"" button in all the ""menu pages"" (credits, how to play, challenges) instead of the only option to return to the ""main menu"" being through the browser itself.
Other than those small comments, I think the overall interface and experience of GAMFLEW are very nice and well-built, and I would definitely use this game to learn software testing if I had the opportunity. Good Job!"

When we come out of a challenge on the 'test file 2: Is Board valid?', the modal for 'test file 1: Is move valid?' is opened. From there, I must scroll down to open the test file 2 modal. You can save the previous state of the previous test file modal opened so that the scrolling time is saved. "
