AB  - In order to improve the teaching function and operation performance of the MOOC teaching system in colleges and universities, under the condition of online learning, a lightweight MOOC teaching system in colleges and universities is designed from three aspects: hardware, database and software. In terms of hardware, the program operation controller, teaching data acquisition and transmission module of the system are mainly modified and optimized. Collect the user and related teaching resource data in the teaching system, install it in a certain format to form a database table, and obtain the design result of the system database through the logical relationship between the database tables. This process keeps the system running in a lightweight state. With the support of hardware devices and databases, the identity of the users entering the system is determined, and students and teachers are given different functional rights. The software teaching function of the system is realized through the design and development of functional modules such as interactive practice of lightweight MOOC teaching content, uploading MOOC teaching resources, online testing and score management in the course management module. Through the system test experiment, it is concluded that the functional operation success rate of the designed system is higher than 99%, and the operation performance of the system in the two aspects of response speed and concurrency has been significantly improved. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - IS curricula require constant updating to accommodate the emergence of new technologies. Designing and delivering effective emerging technology courses within the constraints of existing programs remains an important challenge faculty face. This paper presents a template for approaching these courses from a learning theory perspective. Results of tests of this template, developed for teaching blockchain, indicate that it successfully strikes the balance needed in an IS program while simplifying the work of designing the structure of an emerging technology course. Additionally, this design was able to deliver this success in an online format, which can be a more challenging format for observing application of knowledge. Blockchain is a disruptive emerging technology opportunity for businesses to unlock value through trusted and “smart” peer-to-peer transactions, wherein smart means businesspeople can custom design processes for verification and transfer of assets. The blockchain example provided here includes a flexible 7-scenario design targeted to enable a constructive, project-based learning approach focused on authentic learning experiences. The template as applied to blockchain may be used directly or adapted for easier development of other emerging technology courses. © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - The concept of “embedding ideological education into curriculum”, briefly called “curriculum ideology”, can be regarded as a new kind of “holistic education” concept. Implementing curriculum ideology in the teaching of engineering courses can simultaneously cultivate the academic and non-academic abilities of engineering college students. At present, such teaching practices are in the exploratory stage, and effective teaching modes and cases are still desired to support embedding ideological education into engineering curriculum. To alleviate the above problem, a new engineering teaching framework called IKP-CDIO is proposed, and a teaching case under the framework and the teaching effects are detailed with a computer major course named "Software Testing". © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that software testing professionals, for the most part, conduct testing activity in a non-systematic way in software projects developed in the industry. In this sense, with the understanding that it is necessary to educate professionals capable of performing the test activity in a systematic way, the community of Software Engineering educators has paid attention to teaching test criteria. In particular, studies have been carried out in the context of different pedagogical models to recognize the models that manage to promote effective learning. In this perspective, research is being conducted on the flipped classroom pedagogical model. Although there are already experimental studies on this model, they did not investigate whether the student studying with the flipped classroom model can apply the test criteria effectively, deriving the test requirements satisfactorily. Our study emerges intending to analyze these issues. The study is configured using an experimental process that compares the test requirements derived by students who studied with the flipped classroom model, with test requirements derived by students who studied with the traditional teaching model. From the observed dependent variables (efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness), it is possible to notice that students who study with the flipped classroom model derive test requirements that satisfy the equivalence partitioning criterion of the software under test with greater effectiveness compared to students who study with the traditional teaching model. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - As incorporating software testing into programming assignments becomes routine, educators have begun to assess not only the correctness of students’ software, but also the adequacy of their tests. In practice, educators rely on code coverage measures, though its shortcomings are widely known. Mutation analysis is a stronger measure of test adequacy, but it is too costly to be applied beyond the small programs developed in introductory programming courses. We demonstrate how to adapt mutation analysis to provide rapid automated feedback on software tests for complex projects in large programming courses. We study a dataset of 1389 student software projects ranging from trivial to complex. We begin by showing that although the state-of-the-art in mutation analysis is practical for providing rapid feedback on projects in introductory courses, it is prohibitively expensive for the more complex projects in subsequent courses. To reduce this cost, we use a statistical procedure to select a subset of mutation operators that maintains accuracy while minimizing cost. We show that with only 2 operators, costs can be reduced by a factor of 2–3 with negligible loss in accuracy. Finally, we evaluate our approach on open-source software and report that our findings may generalize beyond our educational context. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper presents a data-driven debugging framework to improve the trustworthiness of US tax preparation software systems. Given the legal implications of bugs in such software on its users, ensuring compliance and trustworthiness of tax preparation software is of paramount importance. The key barriers in developing debugging aids for tax preparation systems are the unavailability of explicit specifications and the difficulty of obtaining oracles. We posit that, since the US tax law adheres to the legal doctrine of precedent, the specifications about the outcome of tax preparation software for an individual taxpayer must be viewed in comparison with individuals that are deemed similar. Consequently, these specifications are naturally available as properties on the software requiring similar inputs provide similar outputs. Inspired by the metamorphic testing paradigm, we dub these relations metamorphic relations as they relate to structurally modified inputs.In collaboration with legal and tax experts, we explicated metamorphic relations for a set of challenging properties from various US Internal Revenue Services (IRS) publications including Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return), Publication 596 (Earned Income Tax Credit), Schedule 8812 (Qualifying Children and Other Dependents), and Form 8863 (Education Credits). While we focus on an open-source tax preparation software for our case study, the proposed framework can be readily extended to other commercial software. We develop a randomized test-case generation strategy to systematically validate the correctness of tax preparation software guided by metamorphic relations. We further aid this test-case generation by visually explaining the behavior of software on suspicious instances using easy-to-interpret decision-tree models. Our tool uncovered several accountability bugs with varying severity ranging from non-robust behavior in corner-cases (unreliable behavior when tax returns are close to zero) to missing eligibility conditions in the updated versions of software.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Programming Online Verification Exam (OE) system has been widely used in algorithm education and practice since it can automatically analyze program results (e.g., correct or incorrect) after executing the submitted programs with corresponding test cases. OE systems can provide both execution results and error information so that novice programmers can get feedback quickly. If the submitted program cannot pass all the test cases, the novice programmers will get wrong-answer feedback, and they have to find and fix the errors in the program. Automated program fault localization techniques, which can locate the errors in programs under test automatically, thus help novice programmers fix the errors quickly. However, the performance of current automated fault localization techniques is limited due to the high-density test cases in novice programs of OE system. In this paper, we analyze the impact of test case density (TCD) and execution variety on fault localization performance and propose a method to reduce TCD to improve fault localization precision for novice programs. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct a number of empirical studies on 1199 real fault diagnosis algorithm related novice programs, and the experimental results show that using improved test cases through our method for fault localization in OE system can enhance the precision of fault localization for novice programs. Specifically, after decreasing the test cases' density, the improvement of fault localization accuracy ranges from 0.6% to 17.34% in terms of the Expense metric, and from the Accuracy@N metrics, the number of faulty statements that can be found increases in most cases.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Continuous integration in software development requires to run the tests on a regular basis to ensure that the code does not regress. So that the execution time of the regression test suite remains reasonable its size must be reduced while preserving its fault detection capability. From test execution logs, we extract from each test a trace, which is a sequence of events. We then consider each event as a word, and apply natural language processing methods, here the Word2Vec tool, to detect similarities in sentences, and partition them into clusters. We thus can reduce the regression test suite by removing redundant tests. We present the approach on a small case study, and we use mutation based testing to assess the effectiveness of the reduction. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In 2012, the Ecuadorian Higher Education System implemented a standardized test called “Ser Bachiller” as a compulsory requirement to be admitted on an undergraduate program at any public university of the country. Based on the test, applicants receive a score that allows them to apply to the academic program of their choice. On a meritocratic basis, students with the highest grades from the examination process have greater opportunities to be admitted. The present study focuses on the admission process at Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo (Unach), a public university located in Riobamba- Ecuador. Through the application of knowledge discovery in database (KDD), this analysis generated a data warehouse (DW) after collecting the information of the tests scores from the admitted students and the relation with their academic performance once they were enrolled in the leveling courses. In addition, through Data Mining (DM) processes, it was possible to identify patterns that provide information and knowledge about the relationship between the admission score and the academic performance of the students. In parallel, through Business Intelligence (BI) reports, higher education institutions can inform their decisions in order to generate strategies for strengthening the processes of admission and knowledge leveling. This can allow them to guarantee a high academic performance among the admitted students, which additionally supports the general development of institutions and their undergraduate programs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Exploratory Testing has become increasingly widespread in the industry, one of the reasons being the need to use agile approaches in the quality assurance process. In this context, it was observed that many professionals in the area are hardly able to apply this approach with systematic procedures because they understand it as an informal strategy. From a literature review carried out, a great potential for research was identified, focusing on the education of Exploratory Test Design and Execution. Therefore, this study presents the process of building a systematic teaching-learning approach to support the Exploratory Tests Design and Execution, training students to obtain skills, theoretical and practical knowledge relevant to the industry. For this, a mapping of assets involving the curricula was carried out: training reference for undergraduate courses in computing from SBC (Brazilian Computer Society), Computer Science Curricula from ACM/IEEE and the practical guide from TMMi (Test Maturity Model integration), analyzing the process area of Test Design and Execution. In addition, interviews were conducted with professionals to identify tools, work products and techniques used to make a teaching-learning approach adherent to industry practices and guidelines for theoretical knowledge in the academic context. Therefore, this work provides a set of skills favorable to teaching Exploratory Test Design and Execution, encouraging academic program managers and professors to use the knowledge generated to help them build disciplines containing a systematic application of exploratory testing.

AB  - When debugging, developers engage in activities such as navigating, editing, testing, and inspecting code. Despite being the building blocks of debugging, little is known about how they constitute debugging. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of a “debugging episode” which encompasses the time from when a developer first investigates a defect until when the defect is fixed or the developer stops. We observed 11 professional developers working on open source projects, coding 89 debugging episodes and 2135 instances of activities that occurred during them. Six activities were identified: navigate, edit, test, inspect, consult resources, and other miscellaneous activities. We found that developers spent the most time editing (41%) and testing (29%) during debugging. When addressing time-consuming defects, developers engaged in more diverse types of debugging activities, spent more time inspecting program state, navigating code, and consulting external resources, and spent less time testing. We found that the activities developers do while debugging were more similar than different than the activities that make up implementation work. Developers spent a similar fraction of their time editing and navigating during debugging and implementation work. However, debugging involved significantly more time inspecting (16%) than implementation work (2%), while implementation work involved more time consulting resources (24%) than debugging (6%). We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten developers to gain insights into the challenges that cause developers in longer debugging episodes to engage with more activities. Our findings offer insight into the debugging process and the challenges that developers confront, offering implications for the design of debugging tools, improved debugging education, and future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Data mover challenge (DMC) for Supercomputing Asia organized by the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC), Singapore is a competition for data transfer node (DTN) architecture. This challenge invites experts from academia and industry to test their software and products on advanced 100G research and education networks. The theme for DMC20 is data for science, which focuses on moving the large amounts of data between multiple sites with DTNs and between high performance computing (HPC) centers around the world. In this paper, we present performance evaluation of data transfer protocol, called high-performance and flexible protocol (HpFP), on DMC20. The data transfer tests are done using high-performance copy (HCP), which is an enhanced HpFP-based file transfer tool. The results show that the HpFP outperforms the traditional protocol on scenario with high packet loss. Tuning parameters and problems are discussed to improve the performance of our file transfer tool as well. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - We demonstrate I-REX1, a system designed to help users understand SQL query evaluation and debug SQL queries. I-REX lets users interactively “trace” the evaluation of complex SQL queries, including those with correlated subqueries. I-REX also explains why a query returns an incorrect answer with respect to a reference query over a test database instance—a common use case in education and software regression testing. To avoid the cognitive overload caused by debugging over a large database instance, I-REX lets users focus on smaller instances contained in the large one (which we call “counterexamples”) that still distinguish the two queries. Supporting these features for SQL queries poses two key challenges. First, unlike debugging for procedural languages, it is not clear how to trace a declarative SQL query, because its execution plan often differs from how it was originally written. I-REX offers a novel interface for tracing SQL query evaluation in a way faithful to how queries are written syntactically, even for complex queries involving multiple levels of nesting and correlation. Second, we need a method for finding small counterexamples that handles the complexity of practical SQL. I-REX extends provenance support for SQL in non-trivial ways to work with various query constructs. This demonstration walks through use cases in which I-REX helps users understand and debug SQL queries. © VLDB Endowment. All rights reserved.

AB  - Software Engineering is a foundation of modern computer systems development. The process involves several steps, including Analysis and Design, which are the fundamentals for building software systems. This discipline is offered by several university degrees these days around the world, included among other computer science courses.Nowadays, cybersecurity problems are very related with software weakness or bad designs, as an example one can mention bad implementations, projects with poor quality, lack of testing, among others issues. Overall one bigger problem is the lack of security integration from the inception and designing of the software project.Cybersecurity had gained a lot of attention in recent years. From the everyday desktop software been abused and exploited, such as browser exploits and Windows RDP protocol exploits, to abusing the Internet of Things to create massive botnets capable to disrupt the Internet service, as such as the Mirai attack in 2017.We believe that if security played a basic role from the inception of the software project, a lot of these incidents could be prevented. We previously proposed to introduce cybersecurity basics in the software engineering courses to raise awareness of these problems to future professional software engineers. In this paper, we focus on the first steps of software engineering and how cybersecurity should be embedded as good practices for every student in any given software project.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background. Colonoscopy is indispensable in the diagnosis and treatment of lower digestive tract (LDT) diseases. Skilled colonoscopists are in great demand, but it takes considerable time for beginners to become experts. In addition, patients may refuse to permit primary learners to practise colonoscopy on them. Thus, improving the instructional programmes and models for primary learners is a key issue in endoscopy training. Convenience and a self-paced, learner-centred approach make e-learning an excellent instructional prospect. Therefore, we created the Colonoscope Roaming System (CRS) to assist in colonoscopy teaching procedures. We aimed to develop the e-learning software, test it with beginner colonoscopists and evaluate its effectiveness via subjective and objective methods. Methods. Through a randomized controlled trial, participants were randomly allocated to an e-learning group (EG) or a control group (CG) after a pretest evaluation. The CG learned through the traditional colonoscopy teaching mode, while the EG used CRS in addition to the traditional teaching mode. Subsequent to the training, the participants completed a posttest and colonoscopy examination. TheEGalso completed a satisfaction questionnaire. Results. Of the 84 participants, 81 (96%) finished the colonoscopy learning and evaluation modules of the CRS. No conspicuous differences in the pretest scores were found between the EG and CG (p>0:05). Two months later, the posttest scores for the EG were higher than those of the CG (p<0:001), and the EG had better performance on the colonoscopy examination (p < 0:01). Overall, 86.25% of questions raised in Q1-Q20 were satisfied with the CRS and considered it successful. Conclusions. The use of CRS may be an effective approach to educate beginner colonoscopists to attain skills. © Copyright 2023 Ning et al.

AB  - Software testing is a crucial phase of software development. Educators now are assessing tests written by students. Methods have been proposed to assess the completeness of student-written tests. However, there is more to good test quality than completeness, and these additional quality are not assessed by the previous work. Test smells are patterns of poorly designed tests that may negatively affect the quality of test and production code. We propose to assess test smells in students' code to improve the quality of software tests they write. In the early stages of this research, we will examine whether practitioners actually spend time and energy to remove those test smells summarized by researchers backed by real-world software projects. Then, we will develop and evaluate our new assessment method. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - [Background]: The software industry has a high demand for professionals in the software quality area. However, computing students, in general, leave the university with little or no knowledge in software testing. [Aim] Although previous studies have investigated how software testing is covered in universities, they focus on pedagogical approaches, trends, and technologies for improving the educational process, and do not evaluate in-depth the contents explored. This article addresses a worldwide perspective on the way educators both deal with the software testing subject, materials and details covered, support mechanisms and teaching practices applied, and challenges imposed, and evaluate instruments. [Method] A survey with questions was conducted with software testing professors from April to June 2020 towards investigating the way the subject is taught in the classroom. [Results] Most higher education institutions address the fundamental software testing techniques and criteria, with more completeness in specific than general software engineering courses. Additional findings and discussions are presented in detail throughout the paper. [Conclusion] This study provides a comprehensive overview of the software testing education field from educators' perspectives. We strongly believe it is useful for the understanding of the actual scenario of the topic, provides foundations and directions to new research, guides educators into subjects' conduction and identification of potential weaknesses and solutions to recurrent problems. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Effective development of children's creative abilities on the base of gamification in the process of schooling is an urgent task of computer education. Its high-grade solution will allow, for example, to create of the digital educational products ranging from an application to comprehensive games where everyone student can contribute games or building blocks for existing games. Existing approaches to solving this problem mostly come from the field of using of technological shells to create individual and team games and are distinguished exclusively by the author's character and a narrow-applied sphere for new products. We also note that such systems cannot be effectively developed without comprehensive organizational support at the level of the whole school, when the entire teaching staff and all students are well motivated for the learning process in the form of team games. In this article, the information model of the Unispher platform of the creation and use the smart content for learning is described. The described information model formalizes the subject area and functionality of the Unispher platform according to the defined special requirements, which makes it possible to build the appropriate software shell for the Unispher platform. The main capabilities and functionality of the Unispher platform for Creative Education are considered and substantiated. Intelligent information model to create Unispher platform is suggested. The relations, predicates, rules, operations and functions as constituents of information model were developed. On the base of proposed information model, software for the Unispher platform was developed and tested in some schools in Israel. The technological platform Angular, Python, JWT, AWS (Amazon Web Services) was chosen for software implementation of the Unispher platform. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In college students' programming, there is a general imbalance between theoretical and practical teaching. The online problem judge system is an excellent way to improve students' programming practice ability, which can judge the student's online submitted program by preset test cases of the problem. However, the online problem judge system requires teachers to write many online problems for the programming courses they teach. Teachers are under great pressure to produce problems, resulting in a lower-Than-expected course effect. Therefore, this paper puts forward the idea of constructing the intelligent problem generation software for college students' programming courses and realizes the intelligent problem generation system for college students' programming courses based on the concept of automatic problem generation machine. The system is based on the idea of extensibility and modularization, so that different modules can be continuously loaded into the application program in the form of dynamic link libraries, and it can also generate online test cases while randomly generating problems, thereby reducing the burden of problem generation for programming teachers. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - System verification is often hindered by the absence of formal models. Peled et al. proposed black-box checking as a solution to this problem. This technique applies active automata learning to infer models of systems with unknown internal structure. This kind of learning relies on conformance testing to determine whether a learned model actually represents the considered system. Since conformance testing may require the execution of a large number of tests, it is considered the main bottleneck in automata learning. In this paper, we describe a randomised conformance testing approach which we extend with fault-based test selection. To show its effectiveness we apply the approach in learning experiments and compare its performance to a well-established testing technique, the partial W-method. This evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces the cost of learning. In multiple experiments, we reduce the cost by at least one order of magnitude. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The teaching-learning process may require specific pedagogical approaches to establish a relationship with industry practices. Recently, some studies investigated the educators' perspectives and the undergraduate courses curriculum to identify potential weaknesses and solutions for the software testing teaching process. However, it is still unclear how the practitioners evaluate the acquisition of knowledge about software testing in undergraduate courses. This study carried out an expert survey with 68 newly graduated practitioners to determine what the industry expects from them and what they learned in academia. The yielded results indicated that those practitioners learned at a similar rate as others with a long industry experience. Also, they studied less than half of the 35 software testing topics collected in the survey and took industry-backed extracurricular courses to complement their learning. Additionally, our findings point out a set of implications for future research, as the respondents' learning difficulties (e.g., lack of learning sources) and the gap between academic education and industry expectations (e.g., certifications).  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - For the Sustainable Development Goal measure of Quality Education, the 2019 Global Education Monitoring Report by UNESCO highlighted that there are a limited set of measures to monitor digital literacy skills as compared to financial literacy skills. Furthermore, the United Nation's International Telecommunication Union report shows that across countries, digital skills such as programming skills remains unpopular. Understanding this challenge, the researchers from MIMOS Berhad, Malaysia propose that Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V) Software Testing skill be measured by UNESCO as it is a natural progression in terms of skills enhancements towards programming skills. In partnership with the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development, MIMOS Berhad designed a practical oriented fundamental IV&V Software Testing syllabus for Malaysian working in Small and Medium Enterprise and conducted a training. As a measure of digital literacy skills, a statistically significant improvement from 48.26% to 73.43% average score in IV&V Software Testing skills was observed. By employing a Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Signed-Rank Test, results revealed that the null hypothesis of 'no statistically significant differences between SME worker's digital knowledge level in terms of IV&V Software Testing examination score' can be rejected, Z=-5.449, p < 0.05. Moving forward, an intermediate and advanced level course in software automation testing may be conducted.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Stevens Institute of Technology offers a graduate course on functional software testing that addresses test planning driven by use cases, the use of software tools, and the derivation of test cases to achieve coverage with minimal effort. The course also contains material on performance testing. Teaching performance testing and measurement in a university setting was challenging because giving the students access to a target system would have required more time, resources, and planning than were available. We addressed these challenges (a) by showing the students how resource usage could be measured in a controlled way with the instrumentation that comes with most modern laptops by default, and (b) by having the students use JMeter to measure the response times of existing websites . We describe how students were introduced to the concept of a controlled performance test by playing recordings of the same musical piece with and without video. We make recommendations for the future avoidance of the emergent ethical issue that one should not subject one does not own to anything but the most trivial loads. We also describe some successes and pitfalls in this effort. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - Students sometimes produce code that works but that its author does not comprehend. For example, a student may apply a poorly-understood code template, stumble upon a working solution through trial and error, or plagiarize. Similarly, passing an automated functional assessment does not guarantee that the student understands their code. One way to tackle these issues is to probe students' comprehension by asking them questions about their own programs. We propose an approach to automatically generate questions about student-written program code. We moreover propose a use case for such questions in the context of automatic assessment systems: After a student's program passes unit tests, the system poses questions to the student about the code. We suggest that these questions can enhance assessment systems, deepen student learning by acting as self-explanation prompts, and provide a window into students' program comprehension. This discussion paper sets an agenda for future technical development and empirical research on the topic.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present Zeuss, a software-based tool designed to improve grammar learning process in elementary school children. Despite efforts by the Colombian Government, the results of the final high school test indicate that students have major deficiencies with language, grammar and reading comprehension. Several difficulties have been evidenced in activities like writing essays or understanding academic papers. Among the reasons that may lead to these results include outdated courses, overcrowded classrooms and lack of interest. Design/methodology/approach: A diagnostic test is performed on third-grade elementary school students to assess the current grammar knowledge and identify areas for improvement. The test results are used to design a software-based tool called Zeuss. The authors include playful activities inspired by several pedagogic exercises found in the literature and personalization so that interaction is tailored to specific user preferences and tastes. Findings: Zeuss has been tested with third-grade students of the Gimnasio Campestre San Francisco de Sales elementary school in Bogotá, Colombia. The results show that using the tool leads to an overall improvement in the grammar construction learning process.

AB  - In this paper we present an online IDE (Spinoza 3.0) for teaching Python programming in which the students are (sometimes) required to verbally reflect on their error messages and unit test failures before being allowed to modify their code. This system was designed to be used in large synchronous in-person, remote, or hybrid classes for either in-class problem solving or out-of-class homework problems. For each student and problem, the system makes a random choice about whether to require reflection on all debugging steps. If the student/problem pair required reflection, then after each time the student ran the program and received feedback as an error message or a set of unit test results, they were required to type in a description of the bug and a plan for how to modify the program to eliminate the bug. The main result is that the number of debugging steps to reach a correct solution was statistically significantly less for problems where the students were required to reflect on each debugging step. We suggest that future developers of pedagogical IDEs consider adding features which require students to reflect frequently during the debugging process.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Code review is a widely-used practice in software development companies to identify defects. Hence, code review has been included in many software engineering curricula at universities worldwide. However, teaching code review is still a challenging task because the code review effectiveness depends on the code reading and analytical skills of a reviewer. While several studies have investigated the code reading techniques that students should use to find defects during code review, little has focused on a learning activity that involves analytical skills. Indeed, developing a code review checklist should stimulate students to develop their analytical skills to anticipate potential issues (i.e., software defects). Yet, it is unclear whether students can anticipate potential issues given their limited experience in software development (programming, testing, etc.). We perform a qualitative analysis to investigate whether students are capable of creating code review checklists, and if the checklists can be used to guide reviewers to find defects. In addition, we identify common mistakes that students make when developing a code review checklist. Our results show that while there are some misconceptions among students about the purpose of code review, students are able to anticipate potential defects and create a relatively good code review checklist. Hence, our results lead us to conclude that developing a code review checklist can be a part of the learning activities for code review in order to scaffold students' skills. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - As a typical representative of ideograms, Chinese characters are very different from Latin characters, which consist of strokes and components. Due to the unique nature and construction, the recognition and writing of Chinese characters are the main obstacles to learning Chinese and Chinese culture. The paper aims to focus on Chinese character writing errors of international students, and offer the corresponding teaching strategies to improve students’ character writing ability. Based on the 390 high-frequency wrongly written Chinese characters summarized from 240 Chinese test papers of international students in Wuhan University of Technology, the paper presents a corpus-based study of Chinese character writing errors of foreign students via software AntConc. Through survey and statistic, the paper reveals that there are three main types errors in Chinese character writing of foreign students: stroke error, component error and structure error, accounting for 70%, 12% and 18% respectively, and each type contains several minor categories. Consequently, the paper proposes targeted teaching strategies: systematic explanation of Chinese character theory, the repeated writing exercises in various forms, and applying multimedia and software are considered to be effective to improve the efficiency of Chinese character learning for international students. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper presents a coverage-guided grammar-based fuzzing technique for automatically synthesizing a corpus of concise test inputs. We walk-through a case study of a compiler designed for education and the corresponding problem of generating meaningful test cases to provide to students. The prior state-of-the-art solution is a combination of fuzzing and test-case reduction techniques such as variants of delta-debugging. Our key insight is that instead of attempting to minimize convoluted fuzzer-generated test inputs, we can instead grow concise test inputs by construction using a form of iterative deepening. We call this approach bonsai fuzzing. Experimental results show that bonsai fuzzing can generate test corpora having inputs that are 16-45% smaller in size on average as compared to a fuzz-then-reduce approach, while achieving approximately the same code coverage and fault-detection capability.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - We report on our experience using ACL2 in the classroom to teach students about software testing. The course COSC 2300 at the University of Wyoming is a mostly traditional Discrete Mathematics course, but with a clear focus on computer science applications. For instance, the section on logic and proofs is motivated by the desire to write proofs about computer software. We emphasize that the importance of software correctness falls along a spectrum with casual programs on one end and mission-critical ones on the other. Corresponding to this spectrum is a variety of tools, ranging from unit tests, randomized testing of properties, and even formal proofs. In this paper, we describe one of the major activities, in which students use the ACL2 Sedan's counter-example generation facility to investigate properties of various existing checksum algorithms used in error detection. Students are challenged to state the relevant properties correctly, so that the counter-example generation tool is used effectively in all cases, and ACL2 can find formal proofs automatically in some of those.  © R.

AB  - Unit testing is a vital part of the software development process and involves developers writing code to verify or assert production code. Furthermore, to help comprehend the test case and troubleshoot issues, developers have the option to provide a message that explains the reason for the assertion failure. In this exploratory empirical study, we examine the characteristics of assertion messages contained in the test methods in 20 open-source Java systems. Our findings show that while developers rarely utilize the option of supplying a message, those who do, either compose it of only string literals, identifiers, or a combination of both types. Using standard English readability measuring techniques, we observe that a beginner's knowledge of English is required to understand messages containing only identifiers, while a 4th -grade education level is required to understand messages composed of string literals. We also discuss shortcomings with using such readability measuring techniques and common anti-patterns in assert message construction. We envision our results incorporated into code quality tools that appraise the understandability of assertion messages. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is a method in education where the students work together on a task while the teacher takes on the role of a coach who - aided by information technology - scaffolds their progress and allows them to discover a solution on their own. CSCL exercises are often run following a script, which breaks the activity in a set number of steps to facilitate productive collaboration. This makes it easier for the teacher to orchestrate the exercise - controlling the flow of the activity and attending to the students' needs as they arise. Teacher-facing dashboards are often used to enable orchestration by providing information about and controls to manipulate the state of the activity. Our research is centered on analyzing whether teachers and students can benefit from visualizing epistemic information, i.e. learning analytics data derived from examining the content of students' input. We expect that giving teachers access to epistemic information will facilitate orchestration, reduce the cognitive load required to oversee a CSCL activity, and create the opportunity for teacher-led debriefing - a technique used by educators to make students reflect on the activity they engaged in and thus help them get a deeper understanding of the content that was covered. We also expect that this will ultimately have a positive impact on students' learning gains. We will extend the dashboard of “PyramidApp” - a software tool that implements the CSCL “Pyramid” script - with epistemic information to test our hypothesis. Subsequently, we will analyze how our findings transfer to other CSCL scripts and tools. We thus hope to contribute to the existing knowledge of how learning analytics data can successfully be employed in a CSCL context. We will follow the design-based research method which emphasizes cooperation with teachers and aims to test and apply interventions in realistic scenarios. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Evaluating software technologies with users is a way to ensure the software purpose is accomplished before the system becomes available to the final users. There is a need for researches proposing and evaluating software technologies for autistic users. However, there is a difficulty to involve autistic users in interaction tasks, due to their tendency to isolation and inability to communicate their needs. We aim to explore how are software technologies being evaluated with autistic users. In this research, we carried out a systematic mapping of the literature to identify and analyze scientific publications that report software technologies evaluation with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) users. The data extraction enables us to identify evaluation methods, data collection procedures, professionals involved, test environments, and ASD aspects evaluated. We noted that user tests were conducted in clinics or classrooms with health professionals, teachers, or caregivers intermediating the autistic user interaction with software technologies to promote better engagement. Observation, questionnaires, and interviews are the most common data collection methods adopted. However, we did not identify specific instruments for evaluating ASD aspects related to software technologies. With our results, we aim to encourage the proposal of evaluation protocols for diverse kinds of software technologies such as serious games or educational software. We also expect to support researchers or professionals in selecting and adopting suitable evaluation procedures to assess software technologies with autistic users. In this way, we can obtain more evidence regarding the impact of technologies in ASD behavioral and social skills development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The significance of software testing cannot be overstated, as its poor implementation often leads to problematic and faulty software applications. This problem comes from a mismatch in the required industry skills, the learning requirements of students, and the current teaching methodology for testing in higher and vocational education institutes. This project aims to create seamless teaching materials for testing education that is in line with industry standards and learning needs. Considering the diverse socioeconomic environment that will benefit from this project, a consortium of partners ranging from universities to small businesses has been assembled. The project starts with research into sense-making and cognitive models for learning and doing testing. Additionally, a study will be conducted to identify the training and knowledge transfer requirements for testing within the industry. Based on the research findings and study outcomes, teaching capsules for software testing will be developed, taking into account the cognitive models of students and the needs of the industry. After the effectiveness validation of these capsules, these capsules and the instructional material will be available to other researchers and professors to improve testing education. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Menti's Journey is a singleplayer browser game for elementary school children aged 6-10. As the main character Menti, the player gradually tries to regain their lost emotions and reveals the power associated with them. Accompanied by Super-Menti, the journey leads across several islands where one of the emotions is out of control. Through a camera-controlled emotion recognition software, the children can test their newly discovered emotion powers in mini-games and through interactions with objects in the world to finally regain all lost emotions. © 2021 Owner/Author.

AB  - People with intellectual disabilities often have a sedentary lifestyle that can lead to long-term issues like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and depression. Although literature shows that the main reason for this is the lack of motivation to do physical activity, scarce research has been done in accessible apps to track and foster physical activities that address motivation. This paper presents HikePal, a game-inspired app to motivate individuals with intellectual disabilities to do physical activity outdoors. We have followed a design and creation research strategy using 1) semi-structured interviews with five experts (health care workers, special education experts and software engineers); 2) a focus group with an occupational therapist, a physical therapist and four software engineers; 3) a pilot user test with three individuals with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers. Having social interaction during the physical activity turned out to be a major motivational aspect of the system, whereas reward systems did not attract much of the users’ attention. Regarding the adapted navigational assistance, we found out that easy-to-read text, visual communication and street-level pictures were the key features to achieve successful and understandable guidance outdoors for people with intellectual disabilities. It proved useful to perform a test on the field and to refine the design guidelines in view of a forthcoming large-scale experimental test involving a larger number of persons with intellectual, sensory and motor disabilities. © 2022

AB  - The problems of multithreaded programming are discussed. One way to improve the quality of writing a parallel program is to use a model which can represent the process of parallel computing in details. In this research construction of model of the multithreaded algorithm is carried out using Petri-object simulation technology grounded on stochastic Petri net and object-oriented approach. Synchronous and asynchronous performance can be reproduced in model according to the resources availability. The parallel computation is reproduced with taking into account not only formal rules of threads interaction but also the time delays of program instructions. Due to that simulation results are close to the real which has been obtained by launching a multithreaded program. In particular, the model of a thread pool as one of the most efficient high-level tools of parallel programming is developed. The experimental results show speedup dependence on algorithm complexity, computing resources and parameters of the thread pool. This dependence is revealed both in multithreaded program computation and in the model. Hence, simulation can be used for testing a parallel program with given parameters and resources. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - To create unit tests, it may be necessary to refactor the production code, e.g. by widening access to specific methods or by decomposing classes into smaller units that are easier to test independently. We report on an extensive study to understand such composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of improving testability. We collected and studied 346,841 java pull requests from 621 GitHub projects. First, we compared the atomic refactorings in two populations: pull requests with changed test-pairs (i.e. with co-changes in production and test code and thus potentially including testability refactoring) and pull requests without test-pairs. We found significantly more atomic refactorings in test-pairs pull requests, such as Change Variable Type Operation or Change Parameter Type. Second, we manually analyzed the code changes of 200 pull requests, where developers explicitly mention the terms 'testability' or 'refactor + test'. We identified ten composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of testability, which we call testability refactoring patterns. Third, we manually analyzed additional 524 test-pairs pull requests: both randomly selected and where we assumed to find testability refactorings, e.g. in pull requests about dependency or concurrency issues. About 25% of all analyzed pull requests actually included testability refactoring patterns. The most frequent were extract a method for override or for invocation, widen access to a method for invocation, and extract a class for invocation. We also report on frequent atomic refactorings which co-occur with the patterns and discuss the implications of our findings for research, practice, and education. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Objective To explore the cultivation and application effect of critical thinking ability in the class teaching of clinical-thinking training for diagnostics. Method To select as teaching objects 2 groups of junior students who major in clinical medicine in a 5-year program at Hunan University of Medicine - Group 1 with 182 students and Group 2 with 178 students. Group 1 functions as a control group and Group 2 an experimental group. The control group uses both the traditional teaching and classroom discussion methods for teaching, while the experimental group uses the method of "real cases+ critical thinking"for teaching. Before the class, the students in the experimental group are provided with two cases for their preview work; during the class, they are introduced into case scenes through videos; after the class, the teaching effects of the 2 groups are evaluated through the chapter tests, CTDI-CV scores, and questionnaires. The survey data are statistically analyzed with SPSS20.0 software, and the t test is used for comparison between the two groups. Results The chapter test and the critical thinking ability test for the students in the experimental group score in total respectively (87.17±6.56) and (301.05±29.58), both of which are higher than those of the control group (the two kinds of scores for the control group are (79.27±7.36) and (254.23±24.74) respectively), with the differences statistically significant (P<0.05). The questionnaire-response rate of the experimental group students stands at 100%; most students believe that "real cases + critical thinking"in the class teaching could improve students' clinical-thinking ability in diagnosing diseases, cultivate students' good character of selfless dedication, and familiarize students with the clinical characteristics of related diseases. Conclusion In the teaching process of clinical-thinking training for diagnostics, applying both the real cases and critical thinking is conducive to improving the teaching effect, and therefore it is worth promoting in clinical teaching and practice.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Learning engineering adds tools and processes to learning platforms to support improvement research. One kind of tool is A/B testing-common in large software companies and also represented academically at conferences like the Annual Conference on Digital Experimentation (CODE). A number of A/B testing systems focused on educational apps have arisen recently, including UpGrade and E-TRIALS. A/B testing can help improve educational platforms, yet challenging issues in education go beyond the generic paradigm. In response, a number of of digital learning platforms is opening their systems to learning-improvement research by instructors and/or third-party researchers, with specific supports necessary for education-specific research designs. This workshop will explore how A/B testing in educational contexts is different, how learning platforms are opening up new possibilities, and how these empirical approaches can be used to drive powerful gains in student learning. It will also discuss forthcoming opportunities for funding to conduct platform-enabled learning research. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Click here and insert your abstract according to Conventional Methodologies of teaching environments, the goal was to make the learners strong in basic subjects by traditional way of teaching and learning concepts. The gap in this conventional methodology of learning the basic courses is that there is no interlinking or application oriented or relationship between the needs of Industries. The learners may score highly and graduate very well without the knowledge of present industrial needs. The students are ready to face the world with their theoretical concepts clear in minds but lack in their industry required practical knowledge. This created problem for the students who are getting placed or going for their first job. To bridge the gap between the conventional methodology and Industry requirements, a program elective course Testing and Characterization in association with TESSOLVE Semiconductor Industry is introduced. To overcome a continuous shortage and high demand for qualified test engineers every year. The university and Engineering institutions lack the specialized Automatic Testing Equipments training skills, as the cost is very high for Semiconductor Testing Equipments. This led to the Semiconductor Test Engineering -Skill Development Course (STE-SDC course), which is also certified by TESSOLVE Industry. The course is introduced for the Undergraduates at the final semester level. This step has been initiated by School of Electronics and Communication of KLE Technological University in the Electronics and Engineering Program Curriculum. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Distance education is a new form of education which has been evolving in the field of contemporary education. It has been developed vigorously under the promotion of Internet education platform. Distance education also promotes the cooperation and exchange of traditional teaching in different regions. It does not conflict in function, nor does it form commercial competition. It is a good complementary mechanism of education. The purpose of this paper is to design and implement the platform of distance education, so that learners can flexibly arrange their time for education according to their own situation and improve their learning efficiency. This paper analyzes the problems in the development process from the perspective of the practical application of software, describes and evaluates the specific requirements of the three roles of students, teachers and managers, and makes improvement and improvement. In the case of realizing the basic functions of distance education platform, a new evaluation system based on test paper generation algorithm is proposed and applied to the system to realize the function of online random test. Based on the traditional J2EE architecture, the B/S model based on web is adopted. The designer realizes a functional module which takes students, teachers and administrators as the main roles. Finally, after we have realized all the functions of remote sensing distance education platform, we have checked and tested its system function and software performance. It is found that when the system carries out information transmission with no more than 400, the feedback speed of the system or users is not high, usually less than 0.5 s, which indicates that the platform has good performance and meets the teaching and management requirements of distance education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Peer feedback has been shown to benefit students' learning as it develops their critical thinking and provides more immediate feedback. It relies on the analysis by students of their peers' work following structured criteria. We propose to apply the same principle to programming courses but in doing so by using techniques of software evaluation: software testing. Students run tests on their peers' code and engage in peer feedback discussions on the results of the test runs. In this paper we present a testing-based code peer feedback learning activity, we describe its technical framework and integration with GitLab, and we discuss its deployment in an undergraduate course and initial evaluation.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The field of art is all inclusive, and each art has its own independent theoretical basis and system. This paper mainly studies the practical significance of music aesthetics based on the theory of multiple intelligences. This paper randomly selected two classes of students as the research object, and the ratio of male and female students in the two classes was similar, and the teachers were the same. In the process of the experiment, based on the theory of multiple intelligences, music teaching guidance was given to the students in the experimental class, and the conventional teaching methods were used in the control class. After that, they were trained for 15 weeks. Using SPSS17.0 software to analyze the students' scores, and compare the changes of students' scores before and after the test, and get the experimental results. The average score of the pre-test results of the experimental class was 18.4082, and that of the control class was 18.3725. The sig value of the independent sample t-test was 0.955 > 0.05. The results show that the theory of multiple intelligences has a significant role in promoting music art. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Developing quality software is a complex activity because it combines reasoning, building, and testing skills. There exist different approaches to teaching these skills. Recent research by the Dutch Open University proposed a Procedural Guidance, which provides timely guidance through different views students can use to write code and tests. These views use a JML-influenced annotation language to attach specific information to each part of the code. The management and correct usage of these annotations has shown to be cumbersome. In this paper, we present a tool that aids students through highlighted annotations, view-specific information, warnings and errors, and the generation of test cases. To maximize its usability, the tool is distributed in the form of an add-on to a popular development environment.  © 2022 ACM.

One of the first levels of testing is the Unit Testing, which aims to test the smallest part of the software, such as objects, methods or classes or modules. Motivated by the relevance of unit tests in the software development process and the lack of undergraduate courses where students can relate the theoretical concepts of tests to practical classes, we propose a game-based learning approach, called GAMUT, linked by a narrative for teaching unit tests. The approach consists of three steps: a game to introduce the concepts of unit testing such as testing doubles and the given-when-then structure; a video lesson that uses similar code of the game to explain and exemplify the previous concepts; and an activity with a challenge, in which the students can practice what they learned for example the writing unit tests. The approach was applied to an undergraduate class of a Verification and Validation course at a university. The results showed that the approach helped to engage the students in the learning process of unit testing since most of them were able to successfully complete the proposed activity. Also, the students enjoyed the game, the narrative and the lucidity of the proposed activity.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Our project explores whether multiple robots can be deployed as a therapeutic tool to help children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) practice social interaction and collaboration. We implemented a human-robot interaction (HRI) solution using two different assistive social robots; the NAO humanoid robot and the Cozmo robot. We have several modules available through an iOS app that we developed for children with ASD to engage with these robots in scenarios focused on social interaction and collaboration. We are also in the process of refining an intelligent web interface so that we, as well as therapists and caregivers, can access relevant data collected by our HRI software. The web interface is designed to help caregivers and therapists, along with our team, monitor their child's or patient's progress, and understand which methods work best. The overall goal is to conduct an HRI user study with children with ASD to test how our software solution performs. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Online Judge platforms play a pivotal role in education, competitive programming, recruitment, career training, and large language model training. They rely on predefined test suites to judge the correctness of submitted solutions. It is therefore important that the solution judgement is reliable and free from potentially misleading false positives (i.e., incorrect solutions that are judged as correct). In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 939 coding problems with 541,552 solutions, all of which are judged to be correct according to the test suites used by the platform, finding that 43.4% of the problems include false positive solutions (3,440 bugs are revealed in total). We also find that test suites are, nevertheless, of high quality according to widely-studied test effectiveness measurements: 88.2% of false positives have perfect (100%) line coverage, 78.9% have perfect branch coverage, and 32.5% have a perfect mutation score. Our findings indicate that more work is required to weed out false positive solutions and to further improve test suite effectiveness. We have released the detected false positive solutions and the generated test inputs to facilitate future research.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Testing is the most used process to assure software systems quality. With increasing complexity of software, testing is getting more important. Testing is an intellectual activity that needs to allocate multiple cognitive resources in students, making it a challenging topic to teach in computer science programs. We advocate that testing is both model-based and exploratory, meaning that we can only make useful test models for test case design once we have made enough sense about the testing problem. The latter can only be achieved through exploring, i.e. questioning, studying, observing and inferring. In this paper, we present an initial diagnostic study to understand the sensemaking used by students while creating test models. We found indications of four different approaches used by students when modelling test cases. A plan for further research is presented on how to improve teaching by taking into account the student's sensemaking approaches.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Our work and life is closely related to computer technology, and computer applications are especially prevalent in the education sector. The traditional manual approach requires teachers to select questions from workbooks and books, compile and edit them, and finally layout the test papers. This process is tedious and time consuming, and it is difficult to ensure the level of knowledge coverage and the repetition rate of questions. This paper takes a dynamic probability-based test paper generation system as the background, follows the standard development model of software engineering, adopts an object-oriented approach to design the system, specifies the functional requirements, Design the system architecture and divide functional modules according to the principles of modularity, independence and abstraction, and realize the detailed design of the main functional modules such as user management, course management, and examination paper management builds a dynamic probability model to realize the automatic formation of papers, and makes the task of assigning questions more scientific. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - People with intellectual disabilities (IDs) often have a sedentary lifestyle that can lead to long-term issues like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and depression. Few games and apps promoting physical activity for people with IDs exist, and they do not have a focus on the motivational aspect. This paper aims to find how to develop software that can motivate people with IDs to do physical activity outdoors. For this purpose, we have followed a design and creation research strategy using several qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews with health care workers, special education experts and software engineers; a focus group with occupational therapists, physical therapists and software engineers; and a preliminary pilot user test with 3 users and 2 caregivers aiming to a test of the software on the field and at the refinement of its specifications. Having social interaction during the physical activity turned out to be a major motivational aspect of the system, whereas rewards systems did not attract much of the users' attention. Regarding the adapted navigational assistance, easy-toread text, visual communication and street-level pictures were the key features to achieve successful and understandable guidance outdoors for people with intellectual disabilities. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The increasingly anthropomorphic, at times even autocratic, nature of software, exhibited during routine activities such as decision-making, question-answering, or recommending, has only contributed to the enduring issue of software ethics. This paper, after providing an understanding of the unique nature of software and that of ethicality, models ethicality as a meta-quality attribute and proposes an ethically-sensitive, standards-based, technology-and-tool-independent, applicable to software-as-a-product-or-service, semi-formal framework, comprising interrelated conceptual meta-models that provide an understanding of ethicality, user story environment, and user story process. It describes an approach of integrating ethicality naturally and systematically in the user story process, illustrates this approach by means of representative examples from a variety of application domains, and highlights the associated challenges in doing so. It also presents the results of a preliminary survey of students and professionals on their knowledge and experience of ethics in (agile) software projects. Finally, it outlines directions of research, and provides recommendations for those in academia and industry, which have broad implications for ethically-sensitive (agile) requirements engineering education and (agile) software testing. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - The current trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, known as Industry 4.0, has also an impact on engineering education. This has a significant influence on the field of research on information communication technology (ICT) for education. It means that the digitalization of teaching processes requires not only suitable supporting software tools but also a suitable infrastructure for managing the flow and transmission of educational knowledge within this infrastructure (clouds, remote desktops, virtual spaces, personal computers). In this context, the authors aim to fill a gap in universal ICT support for teaching, and the state of the art in ICT in general. This gap involves reassessing the actual issues in modern education technology and applications, and requires a more universal approach, because global software or cloud and Web services are not automatically suitable solutions for use in personalized teaching situations where the key players are teachers, i.e. individuals. An approach (also supported within the international research Consortium V4+ACARDC), is illustrated by examples such as testing clouds (cloud content management), virtual spaces, and the development of educational packages and supporting software for visually impaired people. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the increasing complexity and business surrounding mobile applications (apps), there is a growing demand from the industry for qualified test professionals. That's why several universities have included app testing content in their curriculum. However, it is observed that novice app testers, despite being able to enter the market, may face barriers when performing activities related to testing. These barriers impact the tester's experience and the quality of software testing. Although there are works that explore the barriers that newcomers face to participate/contribute in open-source communities or participate in projects that are already in progress, none of them address them from the perspective of app testing. Thus, this study advances in answering the following research question "What are the barriers that novice testers face in the planning, execution, and analysis stages of the testing process?". Through an opinion survey with 30 novice testers, six themes and 36 categories of barriers were synthesized, such as lack of knowledge about software measurement and about tools and technologies used in the test. The identification of these barriers can support professors in adapting and prioritizing content on Software Testing, especially in undergraduate courses. Furthermore, such contributions provide indications of the need for research on strategies to mitigate barriers.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - System design is recognized as one of the most critical components of a software system that bridges system requirements and coding. System design also has a significant impact on testing and maintenance activities, and on further improvements during the lifespan of the software system. Software design should reflect all necessary components of the requirements in a clear and understandable manner by all stakeholders of the software system. To distinguish system elements, separation of concerns in software design is suggested. In this respect, identification of the user tasks, i.e., the tasks that need to be performed by the user, is not currently reflected explicitly in system design documents. Our main assumption in this study is that software quality can be improved significantly by clearly identifying the user tasks from those that need to be performed by the computer system itself. Additionally, what we propose has the potential to better reflect the user requirements and main objectives of the system on the software design and thereby to improve software quality. The main aim of this study is to introduce a novel notation for software developers in the frame of UML Activity Diagram (UMLAD) that enables designers to identify the user tasks and define them separately from the system tasks. For this purpose, an extension of UML-AD, named UML-ADE (UML-Activity Diagram Extended) was proposed. Afterwards, it was implemented in a serious game case for which the specification of user tasks is extremely important. Finally, its effectiveness was analyzed and compared to UML-AD experimentally with 72 participants. The defect detection performance of the participants on both diagrams with two real-life serious game scenarios was evaluated. Results show a higher level of understandability for those using UML-ADE, which in turn may indicate a better design and higher software quality. The results encourage researchers to develop specific design representations dedicated to task design to improve system quality and to conduct further evaluations of the impact of these design on each of the above mentioned potential benefits for the software systems. © Copyright 2021 Ozcan et al.

AB  - It is important to properly test developed software because this may contribute to fewer bugs going unreported in deployed software. Often, little attention is spent on the topic of software testing in curricula, yielding graduate students without adequate preparation to deal with the quality standards required by the industry. This problem could be tackled by introducing bite-sized software testing education capsules that allow teachers to introduce software testing to their students in a less time-consuming manner and with a hands-on component that will facilitate learning. In order to design appropriate software testing educational tools, it is necessary to consider both the software testing needs of the industry and the cognitive models of students. This work-in-progress paper proposes an experimental design to gain an understanding of the cognitive strategies used by students during test case design based on real-life cases. Ultimately, the results of the experiment will be used to develop educational support for teaching software testing.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - As public trust in technology companies has declined, people are questioning the effects of digital technologies in their lives. In this context, many evidence-free claims from corporations and tech critics are widely circulated. How can members of the public make evidence-based decisions about digital technology in their lives? In clinical fields, N -of-one trials enable participant-investigators to make personalized causal discoveries about managing health, improving fitness, and improving their education. Similar methods could help community scientists understand and manage how they use digital technologies. In this paper, we introduce Conjecture, a system for coordinating N -of-one trials that can guide personal decisions about technology use and contribute to science. We describe N -of-one trials as a design challenge and present the design of the Conjecture system. We evaluate the system with a field experiment that tests folk theories about the influence of colorful screens on alleged phone addiction. We present findings on the design of N -of-one-trial systems based on submitted data, interviews, and surveys with 14 participants. Taken together, this paper introduces N -of-one trials as a fruitful direction for computer scientists designing industry-independent systems for evidence-based technology governance and accountability. © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Designing assessments in classroom contexts or having them generated automatically requires-Among other things-knowledge about the difficulty of what is assessed. Estimates of difficulty can be derived empirically, usually by piloting items, or theoretically from models. Empirical results, in turn, can inform theory and refine models. In this article, we compare four methods of estimating the item difficulty for a typical topic of introductory programming courses: control flow. For a given set of items that have been tested empirically, we also collected expert ratings and additionally applied measures of code complexity both from software engineering and from computer science education research The results show that there is some overlap between empirical results and theoretical predictions. However, for the simple item format that we have been using, the models all fall short in offering enough explanatory power regarding the observed variance in difficulty. Empirical difficulty in turn can serve as the basis for rules that can be used for item generation in the future.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Educators are rapidly switching to remote proctoring and examination software for their testing needs, both due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the expanding virtualization of the education sector. State boards are increasingly utilizing these software packages for high stakes legal and medical licensing exams. Three key concerns arise with the use of these complex programs: exam integrity, exam procedural fairness, and exam-taker security and privacy. We conduct the first technical analysis of each of these concerns through a case study of four primary proctoring suites used in U.S. law school and state attorney licensing exams. We reverse engineer these proctoring suites and find that despite promises of high-security, all their anti-cheating measures can be trivially bypassed and can pose significant user security risks. We evaluate current facial recognition classifiers alongside the classifier used by Examplify, the legal exam proctoring suite with the largest market share, to ascertain their accuracy and determine whether faces with certain skin tones are more readily flagged for cheating. Finally, we offer recommendations to improve the integrity and fairness of the remotely proctored exam experience. © USENIX Security Symposium, Security 2022.All rights reserved.

AB  - Visualization literacy, the ability to interpret and comprehend visual designs, is recognized as an essential skill by the visualization community. We identify and investigate barriers to comprehending parallel coordinates plots (PCPs), one of the advanced graphical representations for the display of multivariate and high-dimensional data. We develop a parallel coordinates literacy test with diverse images generated using popular PCP software tools. The test improves PCP literacy and evaluates the user's literacy skills. We introduce an interactive educational tool that assists the teaching and learning of parallel coordinates by offering a more active learning experience. Using this pedagogical tool, we aim to advance novice users’ parallel coordinates literacy skills. Based on the hypothesis that an interactive tool that links traditional Cartesian Coordinates with PCPs interactively will enhance PCP literacy further than static slides, we compare the learning experience using traditional slides with our novel software tool and investigate the efficiency of the educational software with an online, crowdsourced user-study. User-study results show that our pedagogical tool positively impacts a user's PCP comprehension. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Software testing prevents and detects the introduction of faults and bugs during the process of evolving and delivering reliable software. As an important software development activity, testing has been intensively studied to measure test code quality and effectiveness, and assist professional developers and testers with automated test generation tools. In recent years, testing has been attracting educators' attention and has been integrated into some Computer Science education programs. Understanding challenges and problems faced by students can help inform educators the topics that require extra attention and practice when presenting testing concepts and techniques.In my research, I study how students implement and modify source code given unit tests, and how they perceive and perform unit testing. I propose to quantitatively measure the quality of student-written test code, and qualitatively identify the common mistakes and bad smells observed in student-written test code. We compare the performance of students and professionals, who vary in prior testing experience, to investigate the factors that lead to high-quality test code. The ultimate goal of my research is to address the challenges students encountered during test code composition and improve their testing skills with supportive tools or guidance.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Software engineers working in industry seldom try to apply formal methods to solve problems. There are various reasons for this. Sometimes these reasons are understandable-the cost of using formal methods does not make economic sense in many contexts. However, formal methods are also often greeted with scepticism. Formal methods are assumed to take too much time, require tools that are too academic, or to be too mathematical to be understood by practice-oriented software engineers. We tested these assumptions by designing a small course around a framework for program verification, aimed at regular computer science students enrolled in a Master's programme. After four lectures and associated exercises, students were given a small verification task where they had to model and verify a real, non-trivial, C function in Why3. A significant majority of students managed to prove a non-trivial functional specification of this C function in the time allotted, and many also pointed out inherent flaws of this function discovered during formalization. Participants reported no major difficulties or mental hurdles in learning Why3, and considered its approach to be appropriate for selected components of safety-critical software. While formal verification tools such as Why3 still have lots of room for improvement, this experience shows that in a short amount of time, software engineers can be taught to use a program verification tool, and obtain usable results without being fully proficient in it. We further recommend that courses on formal methods should also let students explore these as techniques to be applied, instead of only focusing on the theory behind them, as we expect this to gradually lower the barrier to wider acceptance. © 2019 All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays among the problems of distance education the problem of the automatization of knowledge testing occupies a special place. The issues of computer testing are of great interest for university teachers and software developers of such testing systems. Meanwhile, the issues of computer knowledge testing is not completely covered in theory, and the interest in them is often realized by creating an ordinary computer-testing program with a pre-determined set of control tasks. Adaptive testing tools are not sufficiently covered and processed. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: There is an indisputable industrial need for highly skilled individuals in the role of software testers. However, little is known about the educational background of these professionals, their first contact with the role, their preferences in acquiring skills, the impediments they face, and their perception of the software testing role. Objective: In the current paper, we report on the background, skills, learning preferences, and role profiles as described by professionals in software testing, spanning over a significant number of industries, countries, and software development models. Method: We conducted 19 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with software testing practitioners, across eight industries. We performed a content and thematic analysis of the collected data. Results: The practitioners in software testing had diverse educational backgrounds, and their first contact with the testing role was accidental. Exploratory testing was the preferred testing technique, while curiosity was identified as the most important feature in their skill set. Our respondents collaborated extensively with the developers, whom they perceived as a learning source and symbiotic work partner. Conclusion: The professionals in software testing described their skills as a rather undefined heap of knowledge, increasing with each work task. They used mainly informal and hands-on learning approaches. They found it necessary for education providers to present information on software testing. Generally, companies assisted them well in their skill development but need to allocate sufficient time for the learning. We identified five specialties of the role: product owner in testing, UX tester, DevOps tester, test-script automator, and test-process coordinator. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Experimental research is a key part of student projects in many engineering education areas. Modern research methods often require expensive equipment and a well-equipped laboratory to obtain robust and reproducible results. A good alternative for student research is microfluidics. It provides a fast and cost-effective overview of chemical engineering processes such as diffusion, convection, reactions, and phase separation. The purpose of this work was to develop a microfluidic practicum for a Master’s program in chemical engineering and test it with students. The microfluidic technique selected for this research is measurement of diffusion coefficients of various soft matter systems, such as polymers, surfactants and quantum dots T-sensor type microfluidic chips. Such a technique is a valuable tool for students pursuing degrees in nanotechnology, biotechnology, or polymer engineering. Two experimental practicums were developed for engineering students based on microfluidic technology and tested successfully with students. Students obtained reproducible experimental results that are in good agreement with conventional methods. These practicums offer students an overview of chemical synthesis, convection, and diffusion. To evaluate diffusive characteristics of soft matter, students work with a simple tool that is cheaper than bulk methods such as dynamic light scattering. A motivating factor for research is that microfluidic tools can be designed and fabricated by students themselves. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Women are a minority among STEM undergraduate programs in Chile. Less than 20% of the students enrolled in technology-related careers are women, according to the Chilean Higher Education Information Services. The absence of gender-related data on attrition rates among students of these programs in Chile is the main motivation of this work. We conducted a descriptive study of attrition in the Informatics undergraduate program at the UTFSM, a STEMfocused university in Chile. On average, 10% of the new students of the program are female. In the last five years, our program has had a mean attrition rate of 24% during the first year, while 30% of our female students drop out. Their score in the admission test explains to a greater extent both their academic performance in the undergraduate program and their decision to stay/leave, but not completely. Many of the female students with high performance in the mathematics admission test drop out of their studies in the first year. The reasons for their departure remain unclear. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Practical SQL exercises are important for database course learning and teaching. However, lots of existing database online SQL test platform requires complex environmental construction and can not work across platform. Backend database software running requires high level hardware configuration for large number of concurrencies from students during online test or examination. Light-weight, flexible and open-sourced database SQL exercise and assessment platform with pedagogical features for teaching is rare. This paper thus makes use of the recent frontend database technology to develop an open-sourced SQL assessment platform which is based on JavaScript engine and Node.js server for teaching and scoring of SQL programming skills. With this platform, the student can view the query results immediately after SQL execution and teachers can also collect exercisers' information at the backend server. Browser fingerprint technique is also used to detect the plagiarism and cheating behaviour.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Testing software is very important, but not done well, resulting in problematic and erroneous software applications. The cause radicates from a skills mismatch between what is needed in industry, the learning needs of students, and the way testing is currently being taught at higher and vocational education institutes. The goal of this project is to identify and design seamless teaching materials for testing that are aligned with industry and learning needs. To represent the entire socio-economic environment that will benefit from the results, this project consortium is composed of a diverse set of partners ranging from universities to small enterprises. The project starts with research in sensemaking and cognitive models when doing and learning testing. Moreover, a study will be done to identify the needs of industry for training and knowledge transfer processes for testing. Based on the outcomes of this research and the study, we will design and develop capsules on teaching software testing including the instructional materials that take into account the cognitive models of students and the industry needs. Finally, we will validate these teaching testing capsules developed during the project.  © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - We gained insight into ideas and beliefs on testing of students who finished an introductory course on programming without any formal education on testing. We asked students to fill in a small survey, to do four exercises and to fill in a second survey. We interviewed eleven of these students in semi-structured interviews, to obtain more in-depth insight. The main outcome is that students do not test systematically, while most of them think they do test systematically. One of the misconceptions we found is that most students can only think of test cases based on programming code. Even if no code was provided (black-box testing), students try to come up with code to base their test cases on. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Context: With the rising complexity and scale of software systems, there is an ever-increasing demand for sophisticated and cost-effective software testing. To meet such a demand, there is a need for a highly-skilled software testing work-force (test engineers) in the industry. To address that need, many university educators worldwide have included software-testing education in their software engineering (SE) or computer science (CS) programs. Many papers have been published in the last three decades (as early as 1992) to share experience from such undertakings. Objective: Our objective in this paper is to summarize the body of experience and knowledge in the area of software-testing education to benefit the readers (both educators and researchers) in designing and delivering software testing courses in university settings, and to also conduct further education research in this area. Method: To address the above need, we conducted a systematic literature mapping (SLM) to synthesize what the community of educators have published on this topic. After compiling a candidate pool of 307 papers, and applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 204 papers published between 1992 and 2019. Results: The topic of software-testing education is becoming more active, as we can see by the increasing number of papers. Many pedagogical approaches (how to best teach testing), course-ware, and specific tools for testing education have been proposed. Many challenges in testing education and insights on how to overcome those challenges have been proposed. Conclusion: This paper provides educators and researchers with a classification of existing studies within software-testing education. We further synthesize challenges and insights reported when teaching software testing. The paper also provides a reference (“index”) to the vast body of knowledge and experience on teaching software testing. Our mapping study aims to help educators and researchers to identify the best practices in this area to effectively plan and deliver their software testing courses, or to conduct further education-research in this important area. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution enters, the importance of software safety is increasing, but related systematic educational curriculum and trained professional engineers are insufficient. The purpose of this research is to propose the high priority elements for the software safety education program through needs analysis. For this purpose, 74 candidate elements of software safety education program were derived through contents analysis of literature and nominal group technique (NGT) process with five software safety professionals from various industries in South Korea. Targeting potential education participants including industrial workers and students, an on-line survey was conducted to measure the current and required level of each element. Using descriptive statistics, t-test, Borich needs assessment and Locus for focus model, 16 high priority elements were derived for software safety education program. Based on the results, suggestions were made to develop a more effective education program for software safety education. © 2021. KIPS. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Mutation testing exploits artificial faults to measure the adequacy of test suites and guide their improvement. It has become an extremely popular testing technique as evidenced by the vast literature, numerous tools, and research events on the topic. Previous survey papers have successfully compiled the state of research, its evolution, problems, and challenges. However, the use of mutation testing in practice is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we report the results of a thorough study on the use of mutation testing in GitHub projects. Specifically, we first performed a search for mutation testing tools, 127 in total, and we automatically searched the GitHub repositories including evidence of their use. Then, we focused on the top ten most widely used tools, based on the previous results, and manually revised and classified over 3.5K GitHub active repositories importing them. Among other findings, we observed a recent upturn in interest and activity, with Infection (PHP), PIT (Java) and Humbug (PHP) being the most widely used mutation tools in recent years. The predominant use of mutation testing is development, followed by teaching and learning, and research projects, although with significant differences among mutation tools found in the literature—less adopted and largely used in teaching and research—and those found in GitHub only—more popular and more widely used in development. Our work provides a new and encouraging perspective on the state of practice of mutation testing. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Learning engineering adds tools and processes to learning platforms to support improvement research. One kind of tool is A/B testing, which is common in large software companies and also represented academically at conferences like the Annual Conference on Digital Experimentation (CODE). A number of A/B testing systems focused on educational applications have arisen recently, including UpGrade and E-TRIALS. A/B testing can be part of the puzzle of how to improve educational platforms, and yet challenging issues in education go beyond the generic paradigm. For example, the importance of teachers and instructors to learning means that students are not only connecting with software as individuals, but also as part of a shared classroom experience. Further, learning in topics like mathematics can be highly dependent on prior learning, and thus A or B may not be better overall, but only in interaction with prior knowledge. In response, a set of learning platforms is opening their systems to improvement research by instructors and/or third-party researchers, with specific supports necessary for education-specific research designs. This workshop will explore how A/B testing in educational contexts is different, how learning platforms are opening up new possibilities, and how these empirical approaches can be used to drive powerful gains in student learning. It will also discuss forthcoming opportunities for funding to conduct platform-enabled learning research. © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders are the leading causes of disability globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to MSK rehabilitation services; thus, alternative methods of delivering services are needed. We aim to develop, test and implement a novel tele-simulation training program (“Tele-Sim MSK”) to train clinicians to deliver MSK rehabilitation virtually. Development: We will adapt an existing, evidence-based system (Gamified Educational Network learning management system, GEN). We will develop content and simulations to populate GEN using clinical practice guidelines, rapid reviews about best practices for virtual delivery of MSK practice and training, and focus group discussions regarding clinician training needs and perspectives. Testing: We will assess the system's features using user experience and usability scales, and clinician learning outcomes through a pre/post-test pilot study. Implementation: We will explore implementation considerations to inform large-scale implementation through focus group discussions. Thus, we will use a novel tele-simulation approach based on theory, optimal pedagogies and innovative design, and established frameworks to guide development, testing and implementation (i.e., Aim - FineTune - FollowThrough framework, Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), Kirkpatrick Training Evaluation Model). Through Tele-Sim MSK, we aim to improve clinician access to training and change the way clinical MSK rehabilitation is provided, ultimately helping to reduce barriers to care and the burden of MSK disorders. © IMSCI 2020.All right reserved.

AB  - The introduction of distance learning in Ukrainian schools during quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic has updated the study of use of different types of electronic educational resources by teachers to ensure qualitative distance learning. The online survey of 576 teachers in March-May 2020 determined that the introduction of quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic was a catalyst and motivated 12% of the surveyed teachers to start using electronic educational resources to provide the distance learning for students during the lockdown. The analysis of electronic educational resources recommended by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine for use in all schools of Ukraine made it possible to identify areas of educational activity that are insufficiently provided with electronic textbooks and electronic training manuals that have passed the state examination. The results showed that in 2016-2019, electronic textbooks were developed only in some subjects of the 1st, 2nd grades of primary school and 5th, 6th grades of middle school. None of the 5 electronic textbooks developed for high school has passed the examination of the commissions. The electronic manuals that have passed the examination of the commissions also cover only certain subjects, mainly for primary and middle schools. The lack of certified educational and demonstration, control electronic educational resources, which teachers actively used during distance learning, is compensated by teachers with the help of electronic educational resources, developed by other teachers and posted on the YouTube channel or platform Na urok and also self-developed electronic educational resources: presentations, video lessons, tests and interactive exercises. The effective ways to overcome the problem of providing teachers with qualitative electronic educational resources can be: 1) resumption of the program of development at the expense of the state of high-quality electronic textbooks for different classes and subjects in accordance with the gaps identified in the study in providing students with educational electronic educational resources, which have passed the state examination; 2) creation of a state register of self-developed by teachers open electronic educational resources and the development of criteria for assessing their quality; 3) development of a national platform of electronic educational resources, which would place e-textbooks and manuals that have passed the state examination, and independently developed by teachers demonstration, game, control or other types of electronic educational resources, which meet the quality criteria for content and technical implementation. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors

AB  - To ensure the quality of a software system, developers perform an activity known as unit testing, where they write code (known as test cases) that verifies the individual software units that make up the system. Like production code, test cases are subject to bad programming practices, known as test smells, that hurt maintenance activities. An essential part of most maintenance activities is program comprehension which involves developers reading the code to understand its behavior to fix issues or update features. In this study, we conduct a controlled experiment with 96 undergraduate computer science students to investigate the impact of two common types of test smells, namely Assertion Roulette and Eager Test, on a student's ability to debug and troubleshoot test case failures. Our findings show that students take longer to correct errors in production code when smells are present in their associated test cases, especially Assertion Roulette. We envision our findings supporting academia in better equipping students with the knowledge and resources in writing and maintaining high-quality test cases.

AB  - This study aims to compare the effect of technology-assisted problem-based learning (PBL) and the common PBL in cultivating students' mathematical critical thinking skills (MCTS). A meta-analysis was used to conduct this study by selecting the random effect model. The Q Cochrane and Z test were employed to analyze data supported by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Literature search using some databases such as Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and DOAJ found 155 documents. The final process of literature selection established 30 documents published from 2017 to 2021 and indexed by Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Results showed that the effect size of technology-assisted PBL on students' MCTS was g = 0,979 (moderate effect), while the effect size of common PBL on students' MCTS was g = 0,606 (moderate effect). In addition, there was a significant difference of MCTS between students who got technology-assisted PBL and students who got common PBL. It interprets that in cultivating students' MCTS, the implementation of technology-assisted PBL was better than the implementation of common PBL. So, the use of technology in mathematics learning to support PBL should be employed by mathematics teachers in cultivating students' MCTS. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - With the help of visualization analysis software CiteSpace, this study conducted author analysis, research institution analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, keyword mutation analysis on 2219 literatures collected in Degree and Postgraduate Education from 2010 to 2020. It is found that the output of core authors in the field of Postgraduate education research in China has formed a certain scale, and a certain cooperation network has been formed among research institutions, however, the cooperation has a certain regional nature. At present, the hot issues in the field of Postgraduate education research include training quality, dissertations, and tutors. At the same time, the author pointed out that the main reason why educational technology has been neglected in the field of postgraduate education is that postgraduate education focuses more on scientific research than on teaching. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - The dire circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic have had a severely debilitating global impact on education, and led to an urgent transition from the onsite environment (OSE) to the online environment (OLE) for teaching and learning. In that regard, this paper describes the experiences of us and students of our involvement in oral and written tests in multiple software engineering-related courses during 2020 and 2021. The challenges encountered along with the interventions are discussed, and educational lessons based on the reactions and responses of the students are given. The results of a preliminary survey of the students of their learning experience in the OLE are presented and, related to it, the comments from the students highlighting their preferences of the OSE or the OLE are included. The test procedures, processes, and/or practices herein are, in principle, generalizable and potentially applicable to other courses in computer science or software engineering, during emergency remote teaching or even otherwise.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - While testing takes on a fundamental role to verify software quality and correctness, it often results to be overlooked in the educational field and students often approach it unwillingly, due to its repetitiveness. Our aim is to exploit gamification to engage students by providing them with dynamics like competition, self-expression, and personal improvement. We designed and developed Unit Brawl, a gamified application meant to manage multiple rounds, each one consisting of students developing Java programs and unit tests to be executed on each other. The players collect points by writing correct code that does not make the other players' test cases fail, or by writing test cases capable of detecting defects in the other players' code. The results of a preliminary evaluation to assess the functionality and performance of Unit Brawllook promising. They make us confident about its stability, so we plan an evaluation with students in order to verify the effectiveness of the applied game elements in enhancing the students' interest towards testing topics and their learning.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study develops and implements a music instructional resource platform based on fuzzy clustering algorithm knowledge in order to make the management of music teaching quality more scientific and standardised. This study presents the construction scheme of a music instructional resource management system in a higher education institution through requirements analysis, function design, system development and implementation, and system testing of the software system. In this study, a system is developed that uses computational intelligence to calculate the content and topics contained in resources based on semantic similarity, generate category labels, and cluster educational resources in order to integrate educational resources and implement effective management. It not only meets the needs of users who want to access the platform system via mobile terminals but also increases the platform system's utilisation rate. Experiments show that this system's stability can reach 95.37%. The retrieval accuracy is 96.24%, which is 8.94% better than the traditional method. It has the ability to effectively provide high-quality music teaching resources. Using the instructional resource system proposed in this study will improve teaching effectiveness, reduce learners' learning burden, and increase learning efficiency.  © 2022 Meng Wu.

AB  - Out of all the phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the software testing phase consumes the maximum amount of time when done manually. To reduce the expenses and fasten the process of software testing, researchers have proposed many models to automate the software testing to make it efficient, scaled, and less expensive. However, to automate the software testing process, an optimal and efficient set of test cases is required which can test the software for all possible errors and failures. If test cases are generated just randomly, then the test cases may not be optimal and even if the set is large, it can skip some error checking of software. Teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is used in this paper to generate software test case. Approach level and combined fitness function are used to optimize the test cases such that every path including critical path can be covered. Performance of the approach is compared for both fitness functions considering triangle classification problem (TCP). It is observed that TLBO is able to generate better test cases than some existing models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Traditional Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) curricula pay great attention to the training of programming skills and software engineering competence. In practice we find a large "gap"between the two perspectives: even for those students who have good programming skills, it is rather difficult for them to transform the programming-oriented thinking into the engineering-oriented thinking. Software construction, a key knowledge area (KA) in SWEBOK, plays a role for filling such gap in CS and SE education. We design "four transformations"in the course Software Construction and use multi-dimensional software artifacts as the index of the course contents, so as to train students on the design, programming and testing of a software system in terms of five key quality objectives. A set of gradually-deepening labs are designed for students to make practice on various quality-oriented software construction techniques. Two-year practice demonstrates that our course design significantly facilitates the transformation from programming-oriented training to engineering-oriented training and has been widely welcome by undergraduates from CS and SE. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Writing good software tests is difficult, not everysoftware developer's favorite occupation, and not a prominentaspect in programming education. However, human involvementin testing is unavoidable: What makes a test good is oftendown to intuition; what makes a test useful depends on anunderstanding of the program context; what makes a test findbugs depends on understanding the intended program behaviour.Because the consequences of insufficient testing can be dire, thispaper explores a new angle to address the testing problem:Gamification is the approach of converting potentially tediousor boring tasks to components of entertaining gameplay, wherethe competitive nature of humans motivates them to competeand excel. By applying gamification concepts to software testing,there is potential to fundamentally change software testing inseveral ways: First, gamification can help to overcome deficienciesin education, where testing is a highly neglected topic. Second,gamification engages practitioners in testing tasks they wouldotherwise neglect, and gets them to use advanced testing toolsand techniques they would otherwise not consider. Finally, gamificationmakes it possible to crowdsource complex testing tasksthrough games with a purpose. Collectively, these applications ofgamification have the potential to substantially improve softwaretesting practice, and thus software quality. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Models can be used to plan the evolution and runtime adaptation of a software system. Regression testing of the evolved and adapted models is important to ensure that the previously tested functionality is not broken. Regression testing is performed with limited time and resource constraints. Thus, regression test selection (RTS) techniques are needed to reduce the cost of regression testing. Existing model-based RTS approaches cannot detect all types of fine-grained changes that can be made at a low level of abstraction, and they do not consider the impact of inheritance hierarchy changes on the selection of test cases. We propose a model-based RTS approach called MaRTS that classifies test cases based on changes performed to UML class and activity diagrams. It supports both fine-grained and inheritance hierarchy changes. We compared MaRTS with two code-based RTS approaches using four applications. MaRTS achieved results comparable to a dynamic code-based RTS approach (DejaVu), and outperformed a static code-based RTS approach (ChEOPSJ). The fault detection ability of the selected test cases was equal to that of the baseline test cases.

AB  - Traditional approaches to teach software testing lack to align theory with practice in higher education. Problem Based Learning (PBL) is an alternative that allows learning through individual practical experiences. The objective of this paper is to report experiences to teach software testing by using PBL in Software Engineering undergraduate course of Federal University of Pampa. The report covers two editions of Problem Solving course that involved 51 students and focused on students creating and running test cases across software components developed by professors. Data collection had been made by questionnaires with open and closed questions, and data was examined by statistics and Content Analysis technique. As results, we notice evidences of knowledge and perceptions maturing by students about software testing and software quality. We also verify it's possible to mix PBL with other teaching methodologies such as gamification and to amplify their benefits. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - For seizing the potential of serious games, the RAGE project - funded by the Horizon-2020 Programme of the European Commission - will make available an interoperable set of advanced technology components (software assets) that support game studios at serious game development. This paper describes the overall software architecture and design conditions that are needed for the easy integration and reuse of such software assets in existing game platforms. Based on the component-based software engineering paradigm the RAGE architecture takes into account the portability of assets to different operating systems, different programming languages, and different game engines. It avoids dependencies on external software frameworks and minimises code that may hinder integration with game engine code. Furthermore it relies on a limited set of standard software patterns and well-established coding practices. The RAGE architecture has been successfully validated by implementing and testing basic software assets in four major programming languages (C#, C++, Java, and TypeScript/JavaScript, resp.). Demonstrator implementation of asset integration with an existing game engine was created and validated. The presented RAGE architecture paves the way for large scale development and application of cross-engine reusable software assets for enhancing the quality and diversity of serious gaming. © 2016 Wim van der Vegt et al.

AB  - The article presents a controlled experiment in which the convenience of using the Belbin Role Theory for the integration of work teams with the task of measuring the software is explored. The study is developed in an academic environment with students of the Software Engineering degree and analyzes the differences between the metrics obtained with the Function Point Technique, by teams integrated with the Belbin Theory, and those obtained by teams integrated with students selected randomly. The results obtained provide evidence regarding the significant differences in terms of the time spent for the task; it was observed that teams integrated with the Belbin theory take more time. Regarding the five metrics obtained to measure the functionality of the software, differences were found only in the functionality linked to the external outputs. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Software Testing (ST) is an indispensable part of software development. Proper testing education is thus of paramount importance. Indeed, the mere exposition to ST knowledge might have an impact on programming skills. In particular, it can encourage the production of more correct - and thus reliable - code. Although this is intuitive, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies about such effects. Concerned with this, we have conducted two investigations related to ST education: (1) a large experiment with students to evaluate the possible impact of ST knowledge on the production of reliable code; and (2) a survey with professors that teach introductory programming courses to evaluate their level of ST knowledge. Our study involved 60 senior-level computer science students, 8 auxiliary functions with 92 test cases, a total of 248 implementations, and 53 professors of diverse subfields that completed our survey. The investigation with students shows that ST knowledge can improve code reliability in terms of correctness in as much as 20%, on average. On the other hand, the survey with professors reveals that, in general, university instructors tend to lack the same knowledge that would help students increase their programming skills toward more reliable code. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The use of perceptual inputs is an emerging area within HCI that suggests a developing Perceptual User Interface (PUI) that may prove advantageous for those involved in mobile serious games and immersive social network environments. Since there are a large variety of input devices, software platforms, possible interactions, and myriad ways to combine all of the above elements in pursuit of a PUI, we propose in this paper a basic experimental framework that will be able to standardize study of the wide range of interactive applications for testing efficacy in learning or information retrieval and also suggest improvements to emerging PUI by enabling quick iteration. This rapid iteration will start to define a targeted range of interactions that will be intuitive and comfortable as perceptual inputs, and enhance learning and information retention in comparison to traditional GUI systems. The work focuses on the planning of the technical development of two scenarios. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Paying attention to psychological aspect of human being along with meeting his physical needs are among the factors that have found their special place in different sciences such as architectural design. Appropriate design of interior space and facade of spaces will lead to stimulation of positive feelings. However, architects consider it with their personal tendencies and tastes. The aim of the present study is to assess and extract user’s emotions about facade openings of Maskan (Housing) Bank in the city of Sari, Iran. Investigations were conducted through the Kansei engineering method to calculate and obtain the user’s feeling accurately. Questionnaires were set for 200 statistical samples through the semantic differential (SD) method with a 7-point Likert scale. The responses were analyzed in the SPSS software with a mean test, standard deviation, independent sample T-test, one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation. Findings indicate that participant’s background characteristics such as gender, age, temperament, blood group, education and work had effects on users’ emotions. This research also approves a significant relation between design quantitative (type of openings) and qualitative (Kansei words) characteristics in the Kansei engineering technique. The emotion of most of the participants toward picture 2 (triangular openings) was assessed inappropriate. The arched openings in the traits related to religion in words such as loyal, trustee, and moderate with a correlation of 0.6, 0.63, and 0.6, respectively; and rectangular openings with vertical extension in traits related to finance and banking in words such as stability with the correlation of 0.62 had the maximum significant relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper presents a fast and accurate method for programming simple strategies for small autonomous robots based on embedded processing platforms. There are several approaches in programming of mobile and industrial robots, but the most common one is online programming. This method begins with so called teaching phase during which human operator guides the robot by issuing a set of simple commands. All that commands are automatically logged and saved into a command log, which in the operation phase eventually serves as final program. In case of industrial robots, the whole process including teaching and operation phase runs on the same platform, usually PC, which by the rule has convenient user interface. On the other side, small embedded robot platforms do not have appropriate user interfaces and their programs must be written in the form of hard-coded precompiled firmware. This paper describes the architecture of the robot and supporting system which are designed in the way that support convenient usage of PC based software during development phase, and a fast and accurate method for translation of tested command sequence into the embedded platform firmware running the robot during the deployment phase. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Compared to traditional education resource, Interactive Education Resource (IER) includes dynamic content to interact with users in order to enhance comprehension. The contents of IERs are relatively complex because of its dynamic feature. Exploring IERs and understanding its content during resource search become time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a preview generation approach based on automated software testing and image processing. Our approach first analyzes IERs to collect interactive elements and the event list. Based on the interaction related information, our approach simulates user actions and record snapshots step by step. Our approach compares snapshots to generate an image including the basic content, interaction region and dynamic contents. The image is used as the overall preview and the animation of snapshots collected during simulation is used as detail preview of the IER. In the experiment, we evaluate the completeness, correctness, and comprehension of the preview. The experiment result shows that the preview can be used to provide most information in the resource correctly and easy to understand. Our approach can save time for users in understanding the IERs.

AB  - Citizens in an ageing World population are at higher risk of cognitive impairment and dementia with considerable negative consequences for their autonomy and quality of life, that of those who care for them, and the sustainability of health and care systems. Thus, the need for strategies to avoid or delay the process of cognitive decline. Innovative ICT solutions should play a role in tertiary prevention of cognitive decline supporting active and healthy ageing and countering the cognitive decline in the elderly subjects. In this study, we tested whether a computerized cognitive training (CCT) with an application of serious games (computerized neuropsychological battery) may produce an improve of cognitive functions and beneficial enhancement of the resting state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms deranging typically in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Ten AD patients were enrolled and completed the 15 daily CCT sessions. Standard neuropsychological testing and rsEEG recordings were performed before and after the CCT program. eLORETA estimated the rsEEG cortical sources. Statistical results (p < 0.05) showed that the AD patients were characterized by increased performance scores (i.e. accuracy and reaction time) in the execution of the neuropsychological tasks after the CCT program. On the contrary, no statistical difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the rsEEG markers after the CCT program. These preliminary results suggest that the CCT program with this application of serious games may represent a useful and practical approach to slow down the cognitive decline in AD patients even if it has no effect on the cortical neural synchronization mechanisms of rsEEG, possibly because of the impaired integrity of the cholinergic system in these patients. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in making education widely accessible using Internet technologies. Whether it is Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) or simply college courses offered to a large student population using an online platform, both education-focused companies and universities, often in collaboration with one another, have been investing massively in online education. The fact that hundreds, and more often thousands, of students take these online courses raises scalability challenges in assessing student assignments. In this paper, in particular, we present a technique (GUITestMigrator) that addresses the challenge of assessing mobile app coding assignments. Given a set of apps that implement the same specification, but can have completely different user interfaces, instructors normally have to manually run and check each app to make sure it behaves correctly and according to the specification. GUITestMigrator, conversely, allows for developing tests for one of these apps and automatically migrating these tests to the other apps, thus dramatically reducing the burden on the instructor. We implemented GUITestMigrator for Android apps and evaluated it on three sets of apps developed over three different semesters by students of an online graduate-level software engineering course. Our initial results show that our approach is promising and motivates further research in this direction. The paper also discusses possible applications of this approach for test evolution and test migration for real-world apps. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. It is a test program that solves a given task for preventing the attacks made by automatic programs. If the response to CAPTCHA is correct, then the program classifies the user as a human. This paper introduces a new analysis of the impact of different CAPTCHAs to the Internet user’s response time. It overcomes the limitations of the previous approaches in the state-of-the-art. In this sense, different types of CAPTCHAs are presented and described. Furthermore, an experiment is conducted, which is based on two populations of Internet users for text and image-based CAPTCHA types, differentiated by demographic features, such as age, gender, education level and Internet experience. Each user is required to solve the different types of CAPTCHA, and the response time to solve the CAPTCHAs is registered. The obtained results are statistically processed by Mann-Whitney U and Pearson’s correlation coefficient tests. They analyze 7 different hypotheses which evaluate the response time in dependence of gender, age, education level and Internet experience, for the different CAPTCHA types. It represents an invaluable study in the literature to predict the best use of a given CAPTCHA for specific types of Internet users. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Mutation testing is endorsed by software testing researchers for its unique capability of providing pragmatic estimates of a test suite's fault detection capability, and for guiding testers in improving their test suites. In practice, however, wide-spread adoption of mutation testing is hampered because any non-trivial program results in huge numbers of mutants, many of which are either trivial or equivalent, and thus useless. Trivial mutants reduce the motivation of developers in trusting and using the technique, while equivalent mutants are frustratingly difficult to handle. These problems are exacerbated by insufficient education on testing, which often means that mutation testing is not well understood in practice. These are examples of the types of problems that gamification aims to overcome by making such tedious activities competitive and entertaining. In this paper, we introduce the first steps towards building Code Defenders, a mutation testing game where players take the role of an attacker, who aims to create the most subtle non-equivalent mutants, or a defender, who aims to create strong tests to kill these mutants. The benefits of such an approach are manifold: The game can serve an educational role by engaging learners in mutation testing activities in a fun way. Experienced players will produce strong test suites, capable of detecting even the most subtle bugs that other players can conceive. Equivalent mutants are handled by making them a special part of the gameplay, where points are at stake in duels between attackers and defenders. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The usability evaluation of new technologies is a key factor for their success, ensuring that heterogeneous populations of users will be able to easily interact with these technological tools (Moreno-Ger et al. 2012). While usability testing methods applied to general purpose software are varied, evaluating the usability of video games requires special characteristics. If additionally, the games to be evaluated are those that have a purpose beyond entertainment (serious games), the challenge is greater. In this chapter, we present a methodology designed for evaluating the usability of serious games, developed at the IHCLab research group at the University of Colima, Mexico. This methodology has been applied in several case studies of serious games; these games were created in order to improve different skills in students. The methodology and selected case studies are presented below. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Software testing is one of the most important quality assurance activities. However, it is considered a challenge while teaching in undergraduate programs. One of the implied challenges is how to include this topic in computing undergraduate programs and in which level of detail. The industry has recognized the importance of this deeper and more solid formation. Nevertheless, in most cases, teaching software testing is distributed in disciplines and with different levels of detail. Each teaching method of software testing has its own advantages and disadvantages. Understanding this scenario is important for the proposition of improvements and innovations in the way of teaching software testing. This paper presents the results of a survey conducted throughout various Brazilian computing courses in different universities to identify which and how topics on software testing are taught. The objective is to identify the way in which the content is given, the support mechanisms used in the teaching practices, the challenges imposed and the instruments used to evaluate the students’ learning. The survey was conducted in November of 2017 with Higher Education Institutions (HEI) lecturers distributed in different regions of Brazil, which have undergraduate programs in computer science. From the results, suggestions are presented and discussed in order to promote the dissemination of knowledge in this area of software engineering. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This research investigates the educational effects of online-integrated science program for economically disadvantaged 6th grade students. There were two classes with different learning methods: one with only the online-mentor and the other with both online and onsite mentors. The students received self-esteem scale and academic self-efficacy test at the very first and last class of the program. As a result, students showed positive alteration of self-esteem and academic self-efficacy after the program, meaning this program is effective at developing student's self-esteem and academic self-efficacy. This proposes that more education programs should be provided in order to raise underprivileged students with high potential into outstanding individuals. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Computer science programs have been delivering newly undergraduate students to the software industry without sufficient knowledge on how to perform software testing activities. It occurs because that activity is usually taught as part of Software Engineering courses, which means that teachers have to put a lot of efforts to teach the main testing techniques and criteria along with many other contents. In this way, the content is mostly addressed in a theoretical way as the teacher has to stick to the course schedule and has no time to address the testing practice. On the other hand, some studies reported the efforts of professors to optimize the time during classes and attract students to the software testing area. These efforts are associated with the employment of activities in which students are actively engaged in the classroom, solving problems, developing real projects, or dealing with real cases. A pedagogical model that seeks to leverage such an approach is the flipped classroom model. However, while some have praised that model, others have criticized it. In the state of the art, there is no consensus about the appropriateness of flipped classroom for specific learning contents. In this paper, we present an experimental study that was conducted to verify the suitability of the flipped classroom model to teach software testing, especially black-box testing. This study comprised an analysis of students’ learning gains when subject to the flipped model and the workload introduced when compared to the traditional teaching model. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Mobile app usage continues to increase and hence more and more small and medium sized enterprises (SME) start their m-commerce. Unfortunately, the importance of mobile software testing has not been equally addressed. Our initial survey showed that mobile testing has not been included in almost all the introductory mobile courses and many SMEs heavily reply on manual testing on physical devices. Practitioners with different backgrounds are learning mobile application development and many of them may not receive any software engineering training. Thus, it will be practical for them to learn software testing tools when studying software testing theory. This paper surveys 42 companies and analyzes the industrial practice on mobile application testing. Then it categorizes and assesses twenty free/open source mobile software testing tools. Eight tools were selected and we conducted workshops on them for SME developers. At the end of the workshops, we interviewed the participants to evaluate the usefulness of the testing tools in their workplaces. We concluded that for industrial SME developers, Sikuli (Advanced GUI testing) and JMeter (server performance testing) would be more helpful than AT&T ARO (power consumption tool) and Lookback (Usability Testing tool). The work contributes to those SME companies and developers which are interested in free mobile testing tools © 2016 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of rehabilitation is to improve the patient functional capacities. Most rehabilitation processes can take a long period of time, which may induce patients to drop out of the treatment. Therefore, it is important to use new strategies to motivate patients for continuing their rehabilitation. This work presents the development of a biomedical system to be used as a control interface for a serious game in physical rehabilitation. The biomedical system allows the use of an electromyography, dynamometer or an inertial sensors based on an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The game was developed inspired in a tennis videogame called Pong and was designed based on the PBL (Points, Badges and LeaderBoard) strategy and adapted to have special features for rehabilitation. The aim of the game is to control a racket by using either EMG, dynamometry or the inertial sensor signals. The game is calibrated and adjusted according to patient limitations. The game performs scoring based on an empirical approach. Preliminary tests showed that the system meets the hardware and software requirements for use in rehabilitation according to the medical compliance for this type of device. Results showed that the dynamometry, EMG and accelerometry signals can easily be used to control the game interface. © 2003-2012 IEEE.

AB  - New approaches that offer good learning experiences driven to computer science education have been applied in different places. One of the ways adopted is the application of dynamics in classrooms that challenge students to work in groups and make relations to situations of their lives. Besides, to improve content retention and students engagement, humor is one good element that should be applied in these dynamics. The "Peanut butter and jelly sandwich challenge" is an example that allows including the idea of challenging students using humor as a support to instructional content. This paper explains how that dynamic was applied to two students' groups. The first experience was offered in a mobile programming course that follows a boot camp style and involved a multidisciplinary group with students from three universities. The dynamic applied was used to present the relevance of algorithmic thinking. The second experience used the first case as motivation, adapting it to cover contents focused on test case writing applied to students of computer science. In both cases we present results gathered, such as learning impact for the students. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Every software can run with the support of a license. One of the IC design software service providers is Mentor Graphics with the HEP program. HEP consists of eight application categories. Two categories of them were used in this paper, namely IC Nanometer Design and Design, Verification and Test. There is twenty Software for HEP licenses in this paper: 9 software for IC Nanometer Design and 11 software for Design, Verification, and Test. The problem faced is the use of software for IC design previously only in analog IC design so that the use of the software is only 61.45%. Then it needs to use an optimized license. This paper aims to create a modeling course that can optimize the use of IC design software on the HEP license. Measurements were made related to the use of software for HEP licenses and comparing with one model and three-tiered models. The result is a 23.08% increase in the use of software in the HEP license. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Parameterized unit testing, recent advances in unit testing, is a new methodology extending the previous industry practice based on traditional unit tests without parameters. A parameterized unit test (PUT) is simply a test method that takes parameters, calls the code under test, and states assertions. Parameterized unit testing allows the separation of two testing concerns or tasks: the specification of external, black-box behavior (i.e., assertions or specifications) by developers and the generation and selection of internal, white-box test inputs (i.e., high-code-covering test inputs) by tools. PUTs have been supported by various testing frameworks. Various open source and industrial testing tools also exist to generate test inputs for PUTs. This technical briefing presents latest research on principles and techniques, as well as practical considerations to apply parameterized unit testing on real-world programs, highlighting success stories, research and education achievements, and future research directions in developer testing. © 2016 Authors.

AB  - The objectives of this study included: (i) a determination of whether there is a difference in manual dexterity as a function of gender and dentistry curriculum and (ii) an assessment of hand anthropometric characteristics on manual dexterity test performance. In total, 155 dental students (86 males and 69 females) in their first, second, third, fourth, and fifth years of a five-year undergraduate program took part in the study that involved a simple manual dexterity test. We used a paired sample t-test to compare differences between males and females and among students of different years. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were computed as a measure of association between parameters. The results demonstrate that anthropometric data of both hands have small but significant effects on test performance, and that small hands are associated with better test performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Android applications are widely used around the world. Most of these applications contain potential crashes. Many recent academic studies focus on black-box testing of Android applications to detect these crashes. A simple random testing tool, Monkey, detects more crashes than the state-of-the-art black-box testing tools, but can not reach some activities that are located deep within the application. We propose an hybrid approach that combines our model-learning tool, AndroFrame, and Monkey. With this hybrid approach, we aim to increase activity coverage and improve crash detection. We conduct experiment on 20 Android applications. As a result, our hybrid approach achieves 2% more activity coverage and detects 21 more crashes compared to AndroFrame. Compared to Monkey, our hybrid approach achieves 24% more coverage and detects 5 more crashes.

AB  - Educational technology is nowadays utilized frequently in programming courses. Still, the final exams are mostly done using "traditional" pen-and-paper approach. In this paper, we present the adaptation of automatically assessed electronic exams in two programming courses. The first course was an introductory programming course taught using Java and the second one an advanced course about object-oriented programming. The usage of electronic exams offers several potential benefits for students, including, for example, the possibility to compile, test and debug the program code. To study the adaptation of electronic exams, we observed two instances of the courses mentioned above. Individual scores, submission counts and time spent on each task were analyzed. This data enabled us to classify the exercises in exams according to their difficulty level. This information can be used to further design exams to measure students' knowledge and skills adequately. The analyzed data and the student feedback seem to confirm that electronic exams are an excellent tool for evaluating students in programming courses, and can be recommended to other educators as well. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Technology can play a part in the healthy aging process, helping people maintain their social life and remaining cognitively active. Individuals over 65 may have little or no knowledge on how to use technology, therefore they need to learn how to use it before being able to benefit from it. The aim of this paper is to test the efficacy of a digital education program in improving digital self-efficacy, self-esteem, and quality of perception of cognitive skills in older adults. Results show that digital self-efficacy significantly improves, while self-esteem and quality of life increase but not significantly after training. Perception of cognitive skills actually decreased or remain the same after the course. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.

AB  - The use of computer simulations for educational purposes helps students assimilate more easily several theoretical concepts. As in other areas, for teaching and research in energy systems, it is available a wide range of simulation programs. Commercial programs are known to be computationally efficient, however, they are sealed, ie, do not allow modification in the source code or adding new algorithms. Because of this, many tools are developed in academics environmental, most with open source and typically designed for a specific aspect of the electrical system analysis. This is the case of UFUFlow program used to calculate the load flow, developed and used within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, in Federal University of Uberlândia (FEELT/UFU). Therefore, this paper presents the main computer methods and programs available for the calculation and implementation of load flow algorithm which can assist students or researchers to choose the best tool that meet their needs. Additionaly, the improvements performed at UFUFlow, together with the tested and updated information provided here, can be used to encourage them to develop their own program. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Managing energy consumption and production is a challenging problem and proactive balancing between the amount of electricity produced and consumed is needed. In this work, we examine mechanisms that give incentives to consumers to efficiently reschedule their demand, thus balancing the overall energy production and consumption. Viewing the smart grid as a MAS, each agent represents a consumer; this agent takes into account its user's preferences and proposes an optimal energy consumption plan via a gamified GUI. To implement this we propose a distributed architecture through which we give the incentives (either economic, or social); we test a number of pricing mechanisms and we develop a very fast agent optimization strategy. We also present experiments both from software simulations on real data and pilot tests with human participants: the simulations allow to evaluate the mechanisms and agents, whilst the gamified tests are useful to assess the usability of the GUI and the usefulness of the agent suggestions. With human subjects, we evaluated which type of incentives is more compelling: economic or social. Results validate that by using our agent optimization approach the performance of the smart grid can be improved, and that specific mechanisms allow better utilization of renewable sources. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The object of the research is the development of Web-based software to support mathematics education in general secondary education institutions. The subject of the research is the development of adaptive educational software on the subject of “Fractional numbers” for students in grade 5 of general secondary education institutions. The purpose of the study is to theoretically substantiate, develop, and experimentally test adaptive learning software on the topic “Fractional numbers” for students in grade 5 of general secondary education institutions. The objectives of the study: 1) to analyze the state of the problem of developing and using adaptive software for teaching mathematics; 2) to substantiate the choice of development tools for adaptive educational software for secondary school students; 3) to develop and experimentally test adaptive educational software on the subject of “Fractional numbers” for students in grade 5 of general secondary education institutions. The results of experimental training using the developed software have shown that the development is not taking into account the change in the individual characteristics of the student (including psychological) in the learning process. This determines the following ways of its development, aimed at improving the level of adaptability: individualization of learning effects; formalization and implementation of the student model; taking into account the procedural characteristics of training in the student model. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Software Estimation is an important part of every Software Engineers' skill set. At Stevens Institute of Technology, we have taught Estimation as part of our Software Engineering Masters Program since 2001. Over the past few years, we have evolved our teaching style to be more experiential and engaging. This case study describes an evolving software engineering pedagogical method using LEGOs, which allows students to get hands-on practice and feedback on their estimation skills and techniques, as well as testing some of the commonly held estimation heuristics. The results of the classroom exercises are positive; the students are very involved and the estimation processes and results are consistent with other software engineering estimation heuristics and models. Student experience Wide-band Delphi, custom models using historical data, the "wisdom of the crowds," estimation model factors (e.g., complexity, motivation, expertise level) and the impact of team size. This teaching technique, since it appears to reinforce software engineering estimation heuristics and models, has the potential to be extended for other software estimation experiential education and experimentation, such as demonstrating the impact of anchoring on estimations. In addition, the students have fun doing these exercises, and become totally engaged in the subject. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Software testing is one of the most used approaches to evaluate and improve the software quality. It allows to verify if a software does what it is intended to do, identifying problems in the software before its deployment. Thus, the teaching of software testing in Computer Science courses is needed to help students develop skills in this area. However, this teaching is usually theoretical. To make it more practical and attractive, serious games can be used. In the literature, several games are proposed to support the software testing learning. However, most of the games available are single player; they do not encourage student interaction during the learning process. In this scenario, this paper presents GreaTest, an educational card game that places participants in the role of test analysts. They indicate which test types are most appropriate for testing each scenario presented on the game cards. This game was evaluated with teachers, undergraduate and graduate students. The results indicate that its use contributes to the learning of software testing and the students' motivation. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - With the greater immersion of software development teams to agile methods and practices, it became necessary for students to have earlier contact with Agile Testing practices. Thus, this study aims to use the gamification concepts to stimulate the support to teach and engage the motivation of students in the Software Quality subject taught in postgraduate and undergraduate courses in computer science. For this, classes were set up to teach agile tests that used games elements as motivation for students. Therefore, this research resulted in an enrichment of the knowledge of these students in testing practices. This work aims to contribute to the teaching of agile test practices for students, aiming at a better preparation for the software development market. It was also verified that the use of gamification elements for the teaching of agile tests was efficient, because the participating students dedicated themselves more to the tasks and were participative in all the different types of classes.

AB  - The present study was conducted during the Fall, 2015 semester and is an extension of an ongoing study which follows student performance in math from student entry into the University of Hartford Summer Bridge Program through the first academic semester college math course in Hillyer College.1 Program effectiveness was assessed by: (a) determination of progress made during the Bridge Program as measured by Δ (difference between Post- and Pre-Program test results); (b) student scores from MyMathLab (MML, math-specific software which is integrated into program and semester curriculum); (c) relationships between Δ and MML scores for both the Bridge session and during the first regular semester math course; and (d) relationships between the first regular semester math course exam scores and MML scores for both the Bridge session and during the first regular semester math course. In addition to the Fall, 2015 assessment, GPAs for Bridge and non-Bridge students were compared for Fall, 2014. Results show that (1) student performance improves significantly during the Bridge program; (2) MyMathLab is a significant contributor to improved performance; (3) skills gained from the Bridge Program carry over to the regular semester and potentially extend beyond a single Bridge Program discipline.

AB  - Context Any newcomer or industrial practitioner is likely to experience difficulties in digesting large volumes of knowledge in software testing. In an ideal world, all knowledge used in industry, education and research should be based on high-quality evidence. Since no decision should be made based on a single study, secondary studies become essential in presenting the evidence. According to our search, over 101 secondary studies have been published in the area of software testing since 1994. With this high number of secondary studies, it is important to conduct a review in this area to provide an overview of the research landscape in this area. Objective The goal of this study is to systematically map (classify) the secondary studies in software testing. We propose that tertiary studies can serve as summarizing indexes which facilitate finding the most relevant information from secondary studies and thus supporting evidence-based decision making in any given area of software engineering. Our research questions (RQs) investigate: (1) Software-testing-specific areas, (2) Types of RQs investigated, (3) Numbers and Trends, and (4) Citations of the secondary studies. Method To conduct the tertiary study, we use the systematic-mapping approach. Additionally, we contrast the testing topics to the number of Google hits to address a general popularity of a testing topic and study the most popular papers in terms of citations. We furthermore demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of our results by mapping them to ISTQB foundation syllabus and to SWEBOK to provide implications for practitioners, testing educators, and researchers. Results After a systematic search and voting process, our study pool included 101 secondary studies in the area of software testing between 1994 and 2015. Among our results are the following: (1) In terms of number of secondary studies, model-based approach is the most popular testing method, web services are the most popular system under test (SUT), while regression testing is the most popular testing phase; (2) The quality of secondary studies, as measured by a criteria set established in the community, is slowly increasing as the years go by; and (3) Analysis of research questions, raised and studied in the pool of secondary studies, showed that there is a lack of ‘causality’ and ‘relationship’ type of research questions, a situation which needs to be improved if we, as a community, want to advance as a scientific field. (4) Among secondary studies, we found that regular surveys receive significantly more citations than SMs (p = 0.009) and SLRs (p = 0.014). Conclusion Despite the large number of secondary studies, we found that many important areas of software testing currently lack secondary studies, e.g., test management, role of product risk in testing, human factors in software testing, beta-testing (A/B-testing), exploratory testing, testability, test stopping criteria, and test-environment development. Having secondary studies in those areas is important for satisfying industrial and educational needs in software testing. On the other hand, education material of ISTQB foundation syllabus and SWEBOK could benefit from the inclusion of the latest research topics, namely search-based testing, use of cloud-computing for testing and symbolic execution. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Early school leaving (ESL) is caused by a number of factors, including learning difficulties, social exclusion, lack of motivation, and scarce guidance and support from the school system. However, in Italy some progress was made to improve school quality and outcomes. In this context, we have run a project in an Italian primary and secondary school to test the psycho-pedagogical effectiveness and the usability of a compensatory technological tool, i.e., the TERENCE software, to support the learning process of students with Special Educational Needs (SENs), i.e., students that need particular attention due to biological, social and/or environmental factors. Specifically, we tested the TERENCE software to improve reading comprehension skills and stimulate learning motivation of 16 Italian students with SENs due to cultural, linguistic and socio-economic factors. Children used TERENCE in 8 interactive sessions, for 2.5 hours per session. Their comprehension skills were analyzed via MT standardized test at the beginning and at the end of the stimulation plan. Also usability data was gathered by adopting userbased methods like observational evaluation and semi-structured interviews. The results of the experiment were: (i) students' reading comprehension skills were significantly improved, (ii) students were highly involved and motivated and they learned how to interact with TERENCE very quickly. The pilot study with students with SENs suggested that TERENCE can be easily and effectively used to improve the learning experience of learners with SENs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - This study presents a quality assurance methodology geared to reusable (serious) game software that is posted on the Gamecomponents.eu marketplace portal. This portal provides an online hub for the exchange of serious game software components. The quality assurance methodology comes with a running prototype in C#. It is based on a flexible, plug-in architecture, which allows to flexibly add new checks. The tool starts at solution/project file level rather than code level and covers a variety of issues, e.g. naming conventions, warnings, documentation, portability, namespaces and classes. Specific coding level tests check for portability of game software components. Software testing results show that the approach uncovers a large numbers of hidden flaws and issues that require to be fixed. The tool will empower developers to enhance the quality of their software during development and will contribute to the overall quality level of exposed game software at the Gamecomponents.eu portal. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The training of professionals in the field of software testing is increasing its relevance in the past few years and, therefore, efforts in appropriate methodologies for the learning-teaching process in this context have been proposed and appreciated. The emergence of pedagogical models, such as flipped classroom and team-based learning, which demand from the students a previous study of the theory before the lecture, creates a concern: how to support the before class learning? Because of the hybrid nature of these pedagogical models, which means they mix elements from traditional and distance education, it is possible that the support mechanisms used in distance learning platforms, such as conversational agents, can be applied for this matter. At the same time in which the academic work tries carefully to provide a proper software testing formation, there are also many contributions being established regarding the training and non-formal learning. Improvement and personal training courses about criteria, tools, and software testing good practices are being created by teaching institutes and offered in Massive Open Online Courses platforms (MOOCs). However, in this type of course, in the absence of a teacher, the student might be in a situation where there is nobody available to answer their questions about the topic. In this paper, we propose the use of conversational agents in solving the problems and challenges which encompass the learning through MOOCs and hybrid models. A conversational agent, called TOB-SST is proposed to support software testing education. A viability study was conducted to understand the quality of the given answers by TOB-SST and the possibility of it serving as a learning support tool. The results indicate that it is promising to employ a conversational agent to guide student study. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - GRNsight is a web application and service for visualizing models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). A gene regulatory network (GRN) consists of genes, transcription factors, and the regulatory connections between them which govern the level of expression of mRNA and protein from genes. The original motivation came from our efforts to perform parameter estimation and forward simulation of the dynamics of a differential equations model of a small GRN with 21 nodes and 31 edges. We wanted a quick and easy way to visualize the weight parameters from the model which represent the direction and magnitude of the influence of a transcription factor on its target gene, so we created GRNsight. GRNsight automatically lays out either an unweighted or weighted network graph based on an Excel spreadsheet containing an adjacency matrix where regulators are named in the columns and target genes in the rows, a Simple Interaction Format (SIF) text file, or a GraphML XML file. When a user uploads an input file specifying an unweighted network, GRNsight automatically lays out the graph using black lines and pointed arrowheads. For a weighted network, GRNsight uses pointed and blunt arrowheads, and colors the edges and adjusts their thicknesses based on the sign (positive for activation or negative for repression) and magnitude of the weight parameter. GRNsight is written in JavaScript, with diagrams facilitated by D3.js, a data visualization library. Node.js and the Express framework handle server-side functions. GRNsight's diagrams are based on D3.js's force graph layout algorithm, which was then extensively customized to support the specific needs of GRNs. Nodes are rectangular and support gene labels of up to 12 characters. The edges are arcs, which become straight lines when the nodes are close together. Self-regulatory edges are indicated by a loop.When a user mouses over an edge, the numerical value of the weight parameter is displayed. Visualizations can be modified by sliders that adjust the force graph layout parameters and through manual node dragging. GRNsight is best-suited for visualizing networks of fewer than 35 nodes and 70 edges, although it accepts networks of up to 75 nodes or 150 edges. GRNsight has general applicability for displaying any small, unweighted or weighted network with directed edges for systems biology or other application domains. GRNsight serves as an example of following and teaching best practices for scientific computing and complying with FAIR principles, using an open and test-driven development model with rigorous documentation of requirements and issues on GitHub. An exhaustive unit testing framework using Mocha and the Chai assertion library consists of around 160 automated unit tests that examine nearly 530 test files to ensure that the program is running as expected. The GRNsight application (http://dondi.github.io/ GRNsight/) and code (https://github.com/dondi/GRNsight) are available under the open source BSD license. © 2016 Dahlquist et al.

AB  - Courses related to software testing education, at the university level, in most cases have a learning outcome requiring from students to understand and apply a set of test design techniques upon completing the course. The problem, however, remains on how to both effectively and efficiently evaluate if a student has accomplished the stated outcome. By purely looking at the final resulting set of the test cases provided by a student, it is not evident which, if any, test design technique was used to derive them. In this paper, we are presenting a rather simple but effective method of collecting video assignment submissions from students instead of a traditional source code and tests solution. This way, the teacher could rather quickly and in detail gather evidence that student indeed obtained the knowledge needed for passing the stated learning outcome. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Most of the assessment systems are now using the Classical Test Theory (CTT), the real ability of students is not exactly revealed because they rely only on counting the number of true responses without awaring other characteristics like the difficulty of each item. Several testing software are applied weighted questions but they depend on the sentiment of teachers. The modern testing theories nowadays are built on a mathematical model which can calculate the latent trait of students. The Rasch model is the probability model which promotes interaction between an item and a student. We have constructed a system to estimate students' ability basing on Item Response Theory (IRT) and applying K-Means to classify student ranking. In this paper we present a model to categorize students' levels and compare them to traditional assessment methods. The results indicate that the methods we proposed have shown some significant improvement and they could be effectively applied for other tutoring systems. The result is also meaningful in customizing content and testing ways. Beside, the research is a guide line for teachers or test makers to give other testing approaches for various examinations. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - It is challenging to teach software testing in a way that is engaging for students, and to ensure that they practice effective testing sufficiently. Code Defenders is an educational game that is intended to address this problem: Students compete over code under test by either introducing faults ("attacking") or by writing tests ("defending"). We have integrated Code Defenders as a mandatory component of a software testing course at the University of Passau, which featured ten game sessions of two hours each and involved 120 students. In this paper, we describe how this integration took place and provide some initial insights into our experiences. Code Defenders and the course material are freely available, allowing others to replicate this setup and to gamify their own testing courses. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Software for self-driving vehicles requires intensive testing to avoid fatal accidents and to allow correct operation in real-world environments. Simulation frameworks allow to imitate the behaviour of complex systems such as autonomous vehicles using simplified models of the real world. Hence, they are important tools allowing to extend component and functional tests to address interconnections between sensors, actuators, and controllers in virtual and predefined environments. Existing simulators can be separated into high-level and low-level ones. Both are designed for very specific scenarios and are not suitable for addressing all driving situations. While high-level simulators are suitable for mastering large testing environments such as cities, they lack fine-grained simulation capabilities, e.g., turning of wheels. In contrast, low-level simulators provide a high level of detail with realistic motion profiles. This is usually only possible in small testing environments. In this paper, we present an approach that combines the benefits of both high-level and low-level simulators to execute component and connector models. Vehicle and traffic engineers can choose the most suitable level of detail for their application and integrate real-world environment data from OpenStreetMap. Moreover, the simulator allows for adaptations and extensions of the physical vehicle configuration including new sensors, actuators and control systems. Another feature of our simulator is its automated testing support and its ability to visualize 3D simulations in a browser.

AB  - Cybersecurity is a growing problem globally. Software helps to drive and optimize businesses in every aspect of modern life. Software systems have been under continued attacks by malicious entities, and in some cases, the consequences have been catastrophic. In order to tackle this pervasive problem, emphasis has been placed on educating software developers on how to develop secure systems. The majority of attacks on software systems have been largely due to negligence, lack of education, or incorrect application of cybersecurity defenses. As a result, there is a movement to increase cybersecurity education at all levels: novice, intermediate and expert. At the college level, students can be exposed to cybersecurity skills and principles that will better equip them as they transition into the workforce. A case study is presented which assesses the cybersecurity knowledge of juniors and seniors in a software engineering degree program taught over a one-semester period. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.

AB  - Software systems are present in people's lives and they are increasing to the same extent as their complexity and their criticality. Therefore, we must ensure that these systems maintain high quality in order to behave as expected. To develop high quality software, it is essential to have qualified people who are knowledgeable about Validation and Verification (V&V) techniques, especially software testing. This paper reports on the teaching process in two undergraduate courses in two different contexts: Computer Science students, who can dedicate more time during the day to studying, and Information Systems students, who can only study during the evenings. To engage and motivate the students in the context of software testing learning, we studied ways to bring real industry problems to the classroom in order to adopt the Problem-based Learning (PBL) approach. We chose two real open source projects which, considering the feedback from students and professors, was a good decision. However, the approach requires students to take extra classes rather than teacher-centered approaches. Extra classes may hinder the approach when the class consists of students who work during the day, thus developing a balance between student-centered and teacher-centered can be a good solution in such contexts. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Introduction: Learners’ cognitive error plays a significant role in teaching-learning processes. This study is aimed to investigate the relationship between educational furniture design and cognitive error. Methods: Thirty 18–22 years old students participated in the experiment. Four educational furniture, with different ergonomic characteristics were chosen. The furniture included two types of arm table student chairs (type 1 & 2), one set of library chair and desk (type 3) and one set of adjustable chair and desk (type 4). Each participant spent 90 min on each type of furniture while reading a book and making some notes. A before-after experiment designed to assess cognitive errors by Stroop Test. Paired T-test analysis was used for statistical comparisons at the.05 confidence level in SPSS software. Findings: Comparison before-after errors showed that chairs of type 1 and type 2 could increase errors respectively.86 (P-value =.034) and.63 (P-value =.039). The increasing errors by furniture of type 3 was.40 (P-value =.184). Furniture of type 4 made errors reduction up to.16 (P-value =.517). Comparison between arm table (group 1) and separated table (group 2) showed that group 1 significantly increased errors up to.75 (P-value =.003). Group 2 has insignificantly increased error to.11. Conclusion: The findings revealed a relationship between the ergonomic characteristics of the educational furniture and the number of cognitive errors, as the more ergonomics characteristics of the furniture, the less error. There is also an error percentage reduction using separated chair and desk. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Context: Testing is essential to improve the quality of software products. Despite that, it is not a subject that students are motivated to learn. Gamification is a promising way to address issues in software testing education; it is used to insert game elements in educational contexts aiming to increase students’ motivation and performance. Objective: Reporting on results of an experimental study designed to assess the impact of gamification on software testing education. Method: We carried out the experimental sessions with undergraduate students from three Brazilian institutions. They have been taught basic testing concepts and functional testing. Moreover, the experimental group used a gamified platform that included 10 game elements to increase students’ motivation and performance, attract their attention, and instigate their participation, collaboration, and competitiveness. Results: The experimental group was more motivated than the control group. Regarding performance, the experimental group had an equivalent performance compared to the control group in the pre- and post- tests. However, we observed a trend for the control group to reach a higher performance, as the results from the quiz activities showed significant difference. Conclusion: Although several studies concluded that gamification has the potential to lead to positive outcomes, we reached both positive and negative results. So that, we present our findings and answer whether, in our point of view, it is worth using gamification on software testing education. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Collaboration between industry and academia is important for solving problems and creating innovations. Both sides of industry and academia are important for each other, but sometimes they are incompatible. In this paper, we discuss software testing in industry and academia from their respective views in Japan on the basis of the author's experiences and studies. High quality software is required and its industry is influenced by economic circumstances. In Japan, there are also problems regarding cost reductions, production of high quality software, adapting businesses, and so on. We have made efforts to solve these problems by collaborating with people in both industry and academia. Our efforts include developing test methodologies, skill standards, education syllabi, and so on. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - We introduce an approach to user interface testing with a particular focus on non-native GUI based mobile applications. We particularly address the domain of entertainment and education software including mobile games. We describe a prototype system based on inexpensive components and open source software, intended to support product development cycle for companies on lean budget. On the base of a prototype system discussed in this paper we expect to develop a distributed infrastructure that would allow users to use facilities of users' own computers and connected devices as a part of a common testing framework. The approach presented in this work is also suitable for wider range of mobile applications with a high variety of human-computer interaction mechanisms. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Studies have shown that finding defects in a software system is much cheaper in terms of both money and time spent when done during requirements analysis, as opposed to development or testing. To this end, significant advances have been made in the early detection of system defects. However, research on exposing unexpected system behaviors is relatively scant, especially regarding to non-functional requirements (NFRs). We propose a model-driven approach grounded in formal semantics to expose unexpected behaviors in a set of NFRs and propose future work for evaluating the effectiveness of such an approach.

AB  - Last decade, the integration of information and telecommunication technologies into education has changed the processes of teaching and learning. There are many formats of educational applications that range from simple online tutorials, tests and drill and practice software to integrated web-based educational applications and educational games. So, the following question arises: Which kind of educational software and applications is the most effective and suitable? For answering the above question, in this paper, we present a comparative evaluation between a web-based educational application and an educational game that teach the programming language HTML. Both applications include the same learning material. A group of learners used the two applications for experimental evaluation. We observed and recorded the learners' reactions, preferences and opinions. The observation-experimental data from the usage of the two applications help us to conclude about the educational application that is more likable, offers motivation and engages learners in a higher degree to the learning process. The evaluation results are presented and discussed.. © 2019 Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS).

AB  - Context: Software startups develop innovative products through which they scale their business rapidly, and thus, provide value to the economy, including job generation. However, most startups fail within two years of their launch because of a poor problem-solution fit and negligence of the learning process during minimum viable product (MVP) development. An ideal startup ecosystem can assist in MVP development by providing the necessary entrepreneurial education and technical skills to founding team members for identifying problem-solution fit for their product idea, allowing them to find the right product-market fit. However, existing knowledge on the effect of the startup ecosystem elements on the MVP development is limited. Objective: The empirical study presented in this article aims to identify the effect of the six ecosystem elements (entrepreneurs, technology, market, support factors, finance, and human capital) on MVP development. Method: We conducted a study with 13 software startups and five supporting organizations (accelerators, incubator, co-working space, and investment firm) in the startup ecosystem of the city of Oulu in Finland. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, observation, and materials. Results: The study results showed that internal sources are most common for identifying requirements for the product idea for MVP development. The findings indicate that supporting factors, such as incubators and accelerators, can influence MVP development by providing young founders with the necessary entrepreneurship skills and education needed to create the right product-market fit. Conclusions: We conclude from this study of a regional startup ecosystem that the MVP development process is most affected by founding team members’ experiences and skill sets and by advanced technologies. Furthermore, a constructive startup ecosystem around software startups can boost up the creation of an effective MVP to test product ideas and find a product-market fit. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents an educative game to support the reading learning process through the stimulation of the phonological awareness in children with developmental disorders. The linguistic exercises are performed in the context of a fantasy world, in order to promote a playful phonetic learning. The objective of this serious game is to identify, in different words, in which syllable is a determined sound. The adventure finishes when the player completes the several levels for whole of the alphabetic letters. The performance of each user is recorded into a database, which enables the therapist to monitor the patients progress and detect his/her main difficulties. Tests in users show that the application software is well balanced in terms of complexity. Moreover, results suggest that the tool can make a right discrimination between individuals with and without special needs. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of digital technologies in recent decades, there has been drastic change in the mode of communication and usages of digital accessories in our today lives. It is sure that invention of mobile phone/smart phone has enhanced our life standard and made life easier. The main aim of this research paper is to analyze, design, build and test Bluetooth chat software. The software has been developed as an Interactive and collaborative learning aid. That tool could benefit students in general specially students with disability. Using the developed system, disable students can connect with their peer students, who are within Bluetooth range, without having access to Wi-Fi or Internet. The application does not require any Internet connection, the application works just with Bluetooth connectivity, users can send free message to their friends sitting over classroom, school playgrounds and festivals, when nearby, without a cellular connection or Wi-Fi. Moreover, the application is very easy to use. Bluetooth messaging is also great for making new friends in a library or chatting up someone in crowded places, because one can hook up with anyone who has a Bluetooth-enabled phone. There were previous attempts to create a similar product with little success. Short Messaging Service (SMS) offers the same services as Bluetooth Chat for a fee; but the developed Bluetooth Chat Messenger is free. The research will elaborate on the details. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - This report describes a case study of small-scale effort in employing game playtesting as a starting point for learning about mainstream issues and challenges found in modern software engineering projects and practices. The goal is to be descriptive and informing through a qualitative rendering, rather than prescriptive and quantitative analysis. This study draws attention to the case of where a student with no prior experience in software development or programming must take on the task of learning how to make a game, and along the way learn about many common challenges in modern SE practice through personal discovery and experience. The game itself also imposes challenges in that we have chosen a new, unfamiliar game genre and domain that emphasizes science learning as its purpose for play. Along the way, we discuss issues in requirements, design, prototyping, testing, user experience assessment, and evolutionary software extension, all prior to a formal education in coding or introductory level Computer Science or SE. Though our efforts may seem unusual or anomalous, we believe our methods are open for adoption and reuse by those interested in lowering the barriers to entry into game software development in specific, and into SE more generally. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - This paper presents facial detection and emotion analysis software developed by and for secondary students and teachers. The goal is to provide a tool that reduces the time teachers spend taking attendance while also collecting data that improves teaching practices. Disturbing current trends regarding school shootings motivated the inclusion of emotion recognition so that teachers are able to better monitor students' emotional states over time. This will be accomplished by providing teachers with early warning notifications when a student significantly deviates in a negative way from their characteristic emotional profile. This project was designed to save teachers time, help teachers better address student mental health needs, and motivate students and teachers to learn more computer science, computer vision, and machine learning as they use and modify the code in their own classrooms. Important takeaways from initial test results are that increasing training images increases the accuracy of the recognition software, and the farther away a face is from the camera, the higher the chances are that the face will be incorrectly recognized.

AB  - Learning programming contains several activities, e.g., syntax and semantics of language, program design, comprehension and debugging. Conventional classroom teaching begins with declarative knowledge concepts followed by program writing skills. As a result students attempt to memorize typical program codes instead of writing a fresh code applying the programming concepts. We have applied Program Slicing Technique as a instructional methodology to improve the basic programming skills of the novices. Slicing technique has been widely used in software testing, debugging and software assessment. Results of our study show that slicing technique has helped in improving program understanding and clarification of misconceptions encountered while coding a program. This approach also helps self-learners to gain better programming skills. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Studies have shown that students retain more information when learning by doing, with practical projects. After graduation, students go on to work with real world projects, which often involve more than one discipline, and the components not covered in their university courses must then be learned on the job. Interdisciplinary university projects are often hard to implement due to lack of collaboration between respective parties, as well as different work practices used in each organization involved. While many advances have been made in teaching agile development to software engineering students, members of other faculties often have different, incompatible, work practices that require structured design and testing processes.We will show how incentivizing students from such different backgrounds to work together can have a huge impact in their learning experience and analyze multiple case studies of such interdisciplinary projects. Decisions such as team structure, collaboration, interdisciplinary change management and task prioritization will get evaluated based on the necessary complexity, and good practices will be drawn based on the results of the presented case studies. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Software testing is an important part of Software Quality Assurance. Improving the testing technical ability of software testers is the goal of software testing teaching. Based on e-learning and CDIO education model, this paper proposes a test technical ability training mode integrating courseware resources, exercise environment and training activities, which changes the status of traditional software testing course teaching which emphasizes theory over practice. Teaching practice has proved that the new training method can improve students' interest in learning and effectively promote the training of students' ability of software testing. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In recent years, we have seen an uptrend in the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) driven by the desire to apply these aircraft to a variety of civilian, commercial, education, government, and military applications. With the rapid increase in UAV application, significant effort has been put forth into research and development, which culminates with flight testing of the vehicle. Flight testing occurs using either a partialscale or a full-scale prototype and includes a series of maneuvers used to measure and verify the aircraft’s aerodynamics and control behavior. Most often, UAVs are manually piloted through at least the initial flight testing stage where flight qualities are recorded and translated into control tuning. This paper describes a flight testing automation process to streamline the parameterization of an unmanned aircraft’s flight dynamics. The developed flight testing automator commands the aircraft through a predetermined, conditional set of motions and states to induce certain maneuver sets, which allow for dynamics to more easily be parameterized. The desired maneuver sets follow the standards and generally accepted practices for full-scale flight testing. Specifically, the maneuvers of interest presented in this paper include: idle descent, stall, phugoid, doublets, and singlets, which provide the basis for determining the aircraft aerodynamics, longitudinal stability, and control effectiveness, respectively. The flight testing automator was implemented and demonstrated using software-in-the-loop simulation, including a comparison with manually-piloted flight, followed by flight testing using a fixed-wing trainer-type UAV. Automating the data collection process, as opposed to the previous status quo of manual piloting, would allow for more efficient aircraft parametrization and modelling by minimizing trial-and-error and, more importantly, reducing the flight time required. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) visualizes computer programs for the purpose of facilitating interaction between users and various computing devices. Today’s computers, smart phones and even small devices such as watches are equipped with GUIs. Unlike command based interaction, GUI uses images, labels, push buttons, radio buttons, etc. for the effective communication of users with a software system. GUI testing is a critical part of software testing as it is the door to the actual functionality of software. For the quality assurance, GUI functional testing of a software validates proper interaction between the interface and the user without considering any coding details. In this paper, a strategy based on fuzzy Adaptive Teaching Learning-based Optimization (ATLBO) algorithm, a variant of the basic Teaching Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm, for GUI functional testing is proposed. ATLBO utilizes Event-Interaction Graph (EIG) for the generation of quality test cases. The proposed strategy has produced competitive experimental results against the basic TLBO and other test case generation algorithms. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - [Context] Although Requirements Engineering (RE) is recognized as a critical factor for the success of software and systems development projects, RE related issues are still in the top ten root causes of partial or complete project failures. There are multiple reasons why RE is often neglected or poorly conducted: poor knowledge of the RE methods, techniques and tools, entanglement of problems, practitioners having poor soft skills, stakeholders’ effectiveness and engagement decreasing rapidly, just to name a few.[Relevance] We need more attractive and motivational ways to make stakeholders skilled and properly engaged for efficiently achieving all RE activities. The research community indicated that gamification would be an effective tool to increase performance, creativity and improve the quality of software products in current organizations. [Research Project] This paper describes a gamified approach to make RE’ methods, tools and activities more attractive and easier to be learned and used, and that based on games’ concepts and logic. [Contribution] The research will provides an approach that offers more games for all RE’ activities, and evaluates rigorously their effectiveness to improve RE’ training and RE’ application. [Research method] We follow a design science approach to produce RE games. To experiment with the introduction of these games in the academic and industrial fields, the design, evaluation and validation of the methodology will follow three stages: 1) Design a series of RE games, each game tackles a specific problem and/or activity related to RE; 2) Test each game with BSc or/and MSc students at universities, and experts from real software production organisations; 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of these games through interviews. [Progress] In a early stage of research (from the begening of 2019), a series of RE games (13 games) are collected, we plan also to perform interviews with RE experts to better adapt and evaluate these games to fit their needs, then invent new games that tackles the other RE’ activities.

AB  - We consider a problem of undergraduate students that cannot follow the course schedule of their curriculum. For example, suppose there is a course which should be taken in semester 2 and requires each student to pass a course in semester 1. We can see that astudent who misses the prerequisite course in semester 1 cannot take this course in semester 2. Therefore, his study plan has to be changed from the curriculum suggestion. In this paper, we present a web application that helps students to plan when they should take each of the remaining courses in their curriculum. To create a good plan, we propose a genetic algorithm that finds and improves plans according to all course conditions, such as prerequisites or opening semesters of each course. Moreover, we also consider totalunits of each semester, with estimation of each semesters GPA and cumulative GPA, using historical data of each course. We test our algorithm with the Computer Engineering and Informatics program in Faculty of Engineering at Sriracha, Kasetsart University SrirachaCampus, Thailand. The experiment shows that we can find a good plan in approximately 50 generations. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Our work focuses on a multi-institutional implementation and evaluation of a Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) at scale, providing feedback to N=337 aspiring STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) students participating in a region-wide positioning test before entering the study program. Study advisors were closely involved in the design and evaluation of the dashboard. The multi-institutional context of our case study requires careful consideration of external stakeholders and data ownership and portability issues, which gives shape to the technical design of the LAD. Our approach confirms students as active agents with data ownership, using an anonymous feedback code to access the LAD and to enable students to share their data with institutions at their discretion. Other distinguishing features of the LAD are the support for active content contribution by study advisors and LATEX typesetting of question item feedback to enhance visual recognizability. We present our lessons learnt from a first iteration in production. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Freshmen applicants are given an entrance examination to determine readiness for tertiary education in all fields. The result of the test is a determining factor whether the applicant is accepted or not in the school or program from which the applicant seeks admission. Schools may opt to use a standardized test which may be purchased from an outside vendor or from a teacher-made test which can be validated within by the officer in-charge. Academic achievement represents performance outcomes that indicate the extent to which a person has accomplished specific goals that were the focus of activities in instructional environments, specifically in school, college, and university. The study used the correlation research design to determine the extent to which two factors are related, not the extent to which one factor causes changes in another factor. Respondents are first year to third year students of school year 2015-2016. A total of 69 students who took the entrance examination and enrolled under the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) program served as the respondents of the study. The study used several variables such as the entrance examination results (Stanine) and students' academic performance (final grade) in 25 BSCS professional courses. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Critical thinking ability is a key goal of higher education. This pilot study investigates the suitability of using the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) to evaluate an IS curriculum design in terms of measuring the students’ development of critical thinking skills as they progress through the study program. All currently active students at two similar IS bachelor’s programs at Uppsala University was asked to take the test. The results show that the CCTST can be used for the stated purpose. However, the fact that the test is not available in the students’ native language is an area of concern. The study also points to the importance of developing strategies for increasing response rate and using relevant indicators of study performance.

AB  - In this paper, we developed a hand gesture recognition technology in a human-computer interaction system with several hand gestures. The proposed system can help teacher to control the multi-screen touchable teaching tools, such as sweeping right or left to access the previous or next slide, with a fist to call the eraser tool to rub out the wrong content. To verify its efficiency and other qualities, we conducted a quasi-experiment in our program site in east part of China which analyzed the pre- and post-test scores in Math class of each experimental groups. Moreover, the error recognition rate is reduced by increasing the relevant features and threshold training for the teaching application. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves the high accuracy and real-time performance. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel teaching method practiced in our Object-oriented (OO) course and a quantitative method for assessing how the students' programming skill have been improved. We report the empirical study on the 1956 items of data collected from 249 students who engaged in our course in the spring semester, 2018. A measurement model is proposed to assess students' programming skill in terms of programming performance and testing performance. The observation of how students' programming skills improve along assignments in our OO course is discussed by trend analysis and correlation analysis based on the collected data. The empirical results show that students' testing performance have positive significant correlation with programming performance. Furthermore, the correlation analyses show that design quality correlates with both programming performance and testing performance. Therefore, an early warning metric suite for both programming performance and testing performance in our OO course is proposed to indicate students' success in programming skills and provide hints to code reviewers on conducting the necessary testing activities. This study can give meaningful and useful feedback to programming and testing course instructor regarding to evaluate students' achievement in a programming course. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This paper describes our experience using Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) in a graduate Software Testing course during two semesters. JiTT is a pedagogical strategy that bridges in-class and out-of-class components through preparatory web-based assignments, known as warm-ups. Our JiTT design was as follows. The preparatory outof-class component consisted of a reading test, which required students to read a chapter from the textbook and then answer a webbased test available in our virtual platform. Reading tests were due the day before class in order to give the teacher enough time to read over the student's responses and adjust the next lesson accordingly. The in-class component was organized around student commonmisconceptions or difficulties, extracted from the reading tests submitted by the students. Discussions and cooperative learning activitieswere among the teaching strategies used in class. Our approach was assessed from the students' and teacher's perspective. The students' perspective was obtained from a survey. The teacher's perspective consisted in an assessment of strengths and limitations. Results from our evaluation show that a vast majority of students believe their learning improves when they prepare for class by reading the material in advance. They also think that reading tests are an effective way of verifying that students did the assigned reading. Most of them also consider that JiTT is an appropriate teaching strategy for the course. From the teacher's perspective, a major strength found was that students were more engaged in class, asking interesting questions that enriched class discussion. Also, the use of open-ended (essay-type) questions in reading tests has the additional benefit of helping them become better writers (organize their ideas better and clarify their thinking through writing). © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In this work we describe the current stage of development of a software architecture designed to present discrimination tests to pre-school children in the form of gamified tasks. We interpret the problem of administering these tests as a dialogue model using probabilistic rules to generate customised tests on the basis of the child’s performance. In the proposed architecture, the dialogue system controls a gaming setup composed of a virtual agent and a robotic companion that needs to be taught how to talk. This learning-by-teaching approach is used to camouflage a phonemes discrimination test that has the added value of being generated at runtime on the basis of the child’s performance. We will describe the architectural components involved and we will describe how the dialogue system can make use of linguistic knowledge to generate the discrimination test and administer it by controlling the agents involved in the game.

AB  - In advanced software engineering courses, students profit from taking greater responsibility for and control of their own learning. Because students tend to lack knowledge about the topics they want to learn, facilitation of this learning process is not straightforward. Scrum is a well-known empirical process control model designed to manage complex activities, and is a promising method for facilitating the learning process. This idea was field-tested in a software architecture course as part of a master's degree course with a few participants. Group processes were monitored by questionnaires based on theme-centered interaction. Learning outcomes were tracked by written tests and small projects. The success of the course was compared with the courses of previous years with respect to formal evaluation and grades. Scrum helped in this course by creating a good working environment. Learning outcomes and student satisfaction were substantially better than in previous years. These results suggest that Scrum is a suitable framework for university teaching. This study may serve as the basis for future research and to inspire other instructors. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

During the development process, several questions such as functional test, performance evaluation, and optimization of software architecture for hardware independent implementation to enable reuse and standardization must be considered. For this reason, YellowCar has been developed as AUTSOAR based demonstration platform for evaluation of design methods and education of students in design methodology. Several applications demonstrate successfully YellowCar platform suitability. © 2017 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.

AB  - A practical constraint in the design and development of algorithms and tools for personalized learning is the need to implement adaptive algorithms, oftentimes within complex software environments, without the benefit of a priori large-scale user testing. The lack of such testing makes it difficult to ensure that lessons and guidance from design recommendations and prior studies in other domains has been effectively applied in the training application. This paper summarizes efforts toward a testbed to support verification of adaptive training designs. The testbed operationalizes evidence-based guidance from the research literature and simulated students to enable exploration of design space prior to large-scale implementation. The paper motivates the approach with a specific design question, which is to examine trade-offs between the use of behavioral markers to assess proficiency and the resulting training-content requirements to take advantage of the information that such markers provide. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - Intensive testing is often applied by professional software engineers to assure the quality of enterprise information technology (IT) systems. For example, Netflix's Simian Army consists of services that generate various types of failures, detect abnormal conditions, and test the ability of cloud-based enterprise IT software to survive them. Although software engineering students should be taught these types of rigorous testing techniques, it is often hard to motivate students to produce high-quality test suites for their assignments since classroom environments lack the harsh outcomes of unexpected system failures. This paper provides two contributions to work on strengthening coding and testing skills of software engineering students by aligning educational environment more closely with real-world industries. First, we describe the Holistic Code-Wrecker (HoliCoW), which is our testing method and tool that simulates production environments through forced logical error injections into student projects. The modified versions are then run against regression tests written by students, and the test results are analyzed to determine the robustness of original software. Second, this paper describes preliminary results from our ongoing experience applying HoliCoW to Software Engineering project courses at Vanderbilt University, where the tool is used to automatically evaluate student software project submissions to determine whether regression tests they define detect errors injected into their code. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Automated unit tests are an essential software quality assurance measure that is widely used in practice. In many projects, thus, large volumes of test code have co-evolved with the production code throughout development. Like any other code, test code too may contain faults, affecting the effectiveness, reliability and usefulness of the tests. Furthermore, throughout the software system's ongoing development and maintenance phase, the test code too has to be constantly adapted and maintained. To support detecting problems in test code and improving its quality, we implemented 42 static checks for analyzing JUnit tests. These checks encompass best practices for writing unit tests, common issues observed in using xUnit frameworks, and our experiences collected from several years of providing trainings and reviews of test code for industry and in teaching. The checks can be run using the open source analysis tool PMD. In addition to a description of the implemented checks and their rationale, we demonstrate the applicability of using static analysis for test code by analyzing the unit tests of the open source project JFreeChart. © 2016 IEEE

AB  - Providing feedback on programming assignments manually is a tedious, error prone, and time-consuming task. In [GRZ14], we motivate and address the problem of generating feedback on performance aspects in introductory programming assignments. We studied a large number of functionally correct student solutions to introductory programming assignments and observed: (1) There are different algorithmic strategies, with varying levels of efficiency, for solving a given problem. These different strategies merit different feedback. (2) The same algorithmic strategy can be implemented in countless different ways, which are not relevant for reporting feedback on the student program. We propose a light-weight programming language extension that allows a teacher to define an algorithmic strategy by specifying certain key values that should occur during the execution of an implementation. We describe a dynamic analysis based approach to test whether a student's program matches a teacher's specification. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of both our specification language and our dynamic analysis.

AB  - In a learning process with regards to parameter estimation of item response theory (IRT), which has been related to quite intricate mathematical equations, software use should be an urgent matter. The study was to describe the learning trajectory of item response theory that had been integrated to the use of multiple software and obstacles of advanced IRT course. The study was validation study-type of design research with qualitative approach. The participants in the study were the graduate school students of Educational Research and Evaluation Study Program who concentrated on Educational Measurement. The learning trajectory that had been hypothesized was based on the researcher's experience in lecturing and in identifying the necessary requirements for each chapter in the course. The data were gathered by means of observation during learning, course activities documentation and graduate school students' learning results documentation. The data were analyzed qualitatively. By formulating and testing the hypotheses of learning trajectory, the researcher found that multiple software use in course might assist the students in understanding and improving the students' skills in terms of implementing IRT although they might encounter with several obstacles. © 2017 IOI, Vilnius University.

The aim of the testing was to identify any usability problems with the LM and the application interface and to assess the potential of gesture-based interaction for educational tools. The test exposed the need for providing demonstrations of required gestures at the interface, basing commands on simple and intuitive single gestures, and designing better icons with clear usage descriptions. It also showed that participants found LM-based interaction highly learnable and enjoyable despite the usability problems they encountered and revealed their willingness and enthusiasm for using educational tools which support gesture-based user interaction in the future. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

AB  - Background: Although most Computer Science (CS) programs offered by higher education institutions usually include a software engineering course, some works report a lack of formal training in software testing. Aim: With the aim of studying the possible impact of knowledge acquired from CS programs on software testing, this paper reports an investigation composed of four experiments. The experiments conducted in Spain, Mexico and Ecuador examine the quality of test cases (TC) generated using black-box and white-box methods. The subjects of the experiments were undergraduate and graduate students who were exposed to different levels of CS knowledge. Method: We pool together the data from the four experiments and apply logistic regression to investigate possible relations of the quality of test cases with students' level of exposure to CS knowledge. Results: The quality of test cases generated by students depend significantly on the amount of CS program studied. The odds of generating test cases that reveal failures against those that do not reveal decrease when students are exposed to a low level of CS knowledge. Conclusions: Software testing plays a key role in what is an increasingly complex process of developing and maintaining software products today. The results of our empirical study provide evidence in favor of greater formal training in software testing as part of CS programs. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - This paper presents our experience with the development of an automated knowledge test assembler. Items are selected from an item bank on the basis of precisely formulated formal criteria. The focus of our research was on the classification of criteria for item selection and on an algorithm that assembles a test using these criteria. The criteria are expressed through parameters of a heuristic function used to evaluate a test's quality; they were derived from teaching experience and we consider them to be highly intuitive to teachers. Item selection is performed by searching a state space using modified hill-climbing. The proposed quality function is used to guide the search for the optimal test. The test assembler is implemented inside an in-house software system, developed for preparing and scoring of knowledge tests. We have shown a statistically significant improvement in the mean reliability of the tests assembled by our test assembler, compared to the tests assembled by a widely available state-of-the-art tool. The performance indicators of the test assembler were also measured and analyzed. The experiments' results encourage both practical use of the assembler and further research. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.

The testing of small Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems enables students to gain hands-on experience at reasonable complexity and effort. Like the vehicles tested the Data Acquisition System in design utilizes Commercial o_-the-Shelf components, facilitating the learning curve through prior exposure of students to hard- and software components as well as copious documentation. Thus enabling students to reconfigure the system to allocate resources according to the stated task. First experiments measured the voltage and current of servos operating the flaps of a RPAS, proving the suitability of the chosen approach. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - A grand challenge for artificial intelligence in education is building the Intelligent Problem Solver (IPS) for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) Education. The IPS system has to be able to solve the exercises of the course automatically. It has the following criteria: the knowledge base is sufficient, the program can solve the common exercises in the curriculum of the course based on the knowledge base, the solutions are readable, pedagogical and suitable for the learner's level. Discrete Mathematics is an important course for the undergrad technological curriculum at the university. In this course, knowledge about logic and Boolean algebra is the foundation of logical thinking, it helps students improve their skills in logical reasoning, solving the problems. There are many programs for solving problems in propositional logic and first-order logic; nevertheless, they cannot meet the requirements of a learning support system. In this paper, an IPS system in knowledge domain about logic and Boolean algebra has been proposed. This system satisfies the criteria of the STEM education. It helps students to understand the methods for solving basic and advanced problems: simplify the logical expression in propositional logic, reasoning checking, determine the value or the negative expression of of a logical expression in predicate logic, find the minimization expression of a Boolean function with parameter and non-parameter. In this system, the knowledge base about propositional logic, predicate logic and Boolean algebra at the university for undergraduates has been built based on knowledge model of operators. Via this knowledge base, the inference engine has been designed to solve the kinds of general problems in this knowledge domain. The program has been also tested by the students in University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Creating test cases is a difficult task for students. The number of existing recommendations on how to create test cases is overwhelming. There is a lack of guidelines on how to apply those recommendations one step after another. This problem even becomes more complicated when students are taught to refactor their code as a habit. We propose an approach to teach students how to develop and test their code systematically, with refactoring integrated. In our approach, we pay attention to both functionality and robustness. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

We evaluated the approach with a 7 week undergraduate course on the basics of software testing. Our observations indicate that special care should be taken in stressing the objectives and outcomes of testing work, as these were neglected in many assignments returned by students. By contrast, the students seem to intuitively have good skills in applying testing techniques and defining test cases in exploratory testing work. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Software Testing (ST) is one of the least known aspects of software development. Yet, software engineers often argue that it demands more than half of the costs of a software project. Thus, proper testing education is of paramount importance. In fact, the mere exposition to ST knowledge might have an impact on programming skills. In particular, it can encourage the production of more reliable code. Although this is intuitive, to the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical studies about such effects. Evidence on this matter is important to motivate - or demotivate - classical testing education. Concerned with this, we have conducted a study to investigate the possible impact of ST knowledge on the production of reliable code. Our controlled experiment involved 28 senior-level Computer Science students, 8 auxiliary functions with 92 test cases, and a total of 112 implementations. Results show that code delivered after the exposition to ST knowledge is, on average, 20% more reliable (a significant difference at the 0.01 level). Also, implementations delivered afterwards are not significantly larger in terms of lines of code. This indicates that ST knowledge can make developers produce more reliable software with no additional overhead in terms of program size. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - NetFPGA SUME is a platform of the NetFPGA which has the high performance. In this paper, we introduce the configuration process of the NetFPGA SUME. And an experiment is designed which uses the Socket model to verify the high rate and stability of the NetFPGA SUME. The experiment results illustrate that the NetFPGA SUME can achieve stable switching and realize a high forwarding rate. In addition, we built a dynamic satellite topology based on software define network and test the delay and rate of the network in different scenes. The experiment result shows that the dynamic satellite network under the software-defined network architecture can keep the connectivity during the whole time and recovery quickly from the satellite handoff.

AB  - The teaching of mathematics for visually disabled users still has limitations. One such limitation is related to limited reading of mathematical expressions by screen reading software. With the technological advances, the use of assistive technologies by these people became fundamental for the educational process. However, this technology still has gaps in the ability to read complex expressions and language support, especially in the Brazilian context. Thus, the present study presents usability tests involving visually disabled users on a prototype of screen reading software with reading of mathematical formulae in Brazilian Portuguese and intra-formulae navigation features, named ChromeVox-NavMatBR system. The tests involved 12 users. The evaluations involved the assessmenet of features related to navigation, reading and comprehension of mathematical expressions. Finally, quantitative and qualitative data were collected regarding the use of the system. The study encountered problems related to prosody aspects in formulae reading, response time, comprehension of specific technical terms, and reading of complex mathematical elements. The results in this paper are very important to direct continued development of interactive features to support reading and navigation in complex mathematical content on the Web for people with visual disabilities. © 2019 ACM.

AB  - Crowdsourced testing is an emerging phenomenon in software testing which utilizes benefits of crowdsourcing for software testing. It brings cost and quality advantage with faster delivery of software products. Among all the software development activities, testing is one of the primary activities considered for crowdsourcing. Certain types of testing demand for testers from diverse ethnicity, culture, or geography; crowdsourced testing has become a viable option to address such needs. This paper presents some of the initial attempts done at Accenture to adopt crowdsourced testing. We present some of the software development projects where testing had been crowdsourced using a crowd based platform and yielded promising results. We also showcase how crowd wisdom, gleaned through a sentiment analysis performed on the users' feedback, have helped in improving software. © 2015 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

AB  - This paper investigates high school students' perceptions of the opportunities and challenges of using digital badges to recognize and reward the skills and achievements they acquire in an afterschool science education program. Focus groups and usability tests were conducted with 10 students during the design of a badge system prototype for use in the program. We found that students recognized opportunities for personal empowerment in their use of badges, but also expressed concerns about sharing badges in various online contexts. The findings provide new insight into the values and goals that learners bring to discussions of digital badges in education. These insights hold relevance for designers of education-based badge systems as well as educators seeking to introduce badges into their practice. © Copyright 2015 ACM.

AB  - In software testing through reverse engineering, the programming semiotics are to be transformed to Unified Modeling Language (UML) semiotics. This process needs the abstraction of UML syntactics, semantics from the programming system. As a preamble, this paper attempts to develop an automated methodology to abstract object oriented technology (OOT) components required for the class diagram from the programming system to be tested for its correctness & completeness. The methodology comprises of initial classing & slicing the programming system on the referenced attributes of the entry with no defined attributes and then using the sole referenced entry and sole defined entry on these sliced programming units the candidate key/s are identified which are used to find individual object structure of the class in our classing technique. The programming system is sliced based on individual class structure and then these slices are used to obtain the object methods through whose nature of the parameters we identify the interrelationship between the classes and their types. The intermediate clairvoyant study of parameter indicates the visibility of the object methods. This paper contains the detailed procedure for each method of our automated methodology. Therefore, their correctness and completeness is self evident. The proposed procedures are based on sound logical positivism and implicitly incorporate good database design and good software engineering principles. This paper reengineers the programming system into various appropriate UML design diagrams so as to reduce the enormity of the syntactics and semantics of programming language into limited syntactics and semantics. This enables to develop the correct and complete software testing methodology. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB  - The nation needs more cybersecurity professionals. Beyond just a general shortage, women, African Americans, and Latino Americans are underrepresented in the field. This not only contributes to the scarcity of qualified cybersecurity professionals, but the absence of diversity leads to a lack of perspective and differing viewpoints. Part of the problem is that cybersecurity suffers from barriers to entry that include expensive training, exclusionary culture, and the need for costly infrastructure. In order for students to start learning about cybersecurity, access to training, infrastructure and subject matter experts is imperative. The existing Code Hunt framework, used to help students master programming, could be a springboard to help reduce the challenges facing students interested in cybersecurity. Code Hunt offers gamification, community supported development, and a cloud infrastructure that provides an on-ramp to immediate learning. Leveraging Code Hunt's structured gaming model can addresses these weaknesses and makes cybersecurity training more accessible to those without the means or inclination to participate in more traditional cybersecurity competitions.  © 2015 ACM.

AB  - Academic study of cloud computing is an emerging research field in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia represents the largest economy in the Arab Gulf region, which makes it a potential market of cloud computing technologies. This cross-sectional exploratory empirical research is based on technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework, targeting higher education institutions. In this study, the factors that affect the cloud adoption by higher education institutions were identified and tested using SmartPLS software, a powerful statistical analysis tool for structural equation modeling. Three factors were found significant in this context. Relative advantage, complexity and data concern were the most significant factors. The model explained 47.9%of the total adoption variance. The findings offer education institutions and cloud computing service providers with better understanding of factors affecting the adoption of cloud computing. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

AB  - The Rainfall problem comprises small tasks that have been used to investigate student performance in introductory programming. We conducted several kinds of analyses to inform our understandings of student performance in CS1 relating to this problem. We analyzed implementation approaches and program errors, as in related studies, and also explored the role of test writing vis-a-vis the most common student error. Finally, using correlation analyses and manual inspection of the exam answers, we studied how well the Rainfall problem served as an exam question. The students' implementation choices reected their familiarity with particular loop constructs, while the single most common error concerned division by zero (DivZ), as in many previous studies. Although many students wrote unit tests to guard against DivZ, they often failed to implement according to the tests, which could be partly attributed to the pen-and-paper exam format. From the correlation analyses, we concluded that some students had dificulties with knowledge transfer and that their conceptual understandings of program constructs were insufficient, regardless of them being able to produce working code. The results inform CS1 teachers in preparing materials and exams. © 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Existing malicious JavaScript (JS) detection tools and commercial anti-virus tools mostly use feature-based or signature-based approaches to detect JS malware. These tools are weak in resistance to obfuscation and JS malware variants, not mentioning about providing detailed information of attack behaviors. Such limitations root in the incapability of capturing attack behaviors in these approches. In this paper, we propose to use Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to abstract and summarize common behaviors of malicious JS of the same attack type. We propose an automatic behavior learning framework, named JS∗, to learn DFA from dynamic execution traces of JS malware, where we implement an effective online teacher by combining data dependency analysis, defense rules and trace replay mechanism. We evaluate JS∗ using real world data of 10000 benign and 276 malicious JS samples to cover 8 most-infectious attack types. The results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach in the malware detection and classification, compared with commercial anti-virus tools. We also show how to use our DFAs to detect variants and new attacks. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - Background: Most of the experiments in software engineering (SE) employ students as subjects. This raises concerns about the realism of the results acquired through students and adaptability of the results to software industry. Aim: We compare students and professionals to understand how well students represent professionals as experimental subjects in SE research. Method: The comparison was made in the context of two test-driven development experiments conducted with students in an academic setting and with professionals in a software organization. We measured the code quality of several tasks implemented by both subject groups and checked whether students and professionals perform similarly in terms of code quality metrics. Results: Except for minor differences, neither of the subject groups is better than the other. Professionals produce larger, yet less complex, methods when they use their traditional development approach, whereas both subject groups perform similarly when they apply a new approach for the first time. Conclusion: Given a carefully scoped experiment on a development approach that is new to both students and professionals, similar performances are observed. Further investigation is necessary to analyze the effects of subject demographics and level of experience on the results of SE experiments. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This study follows student performance in math from student entry into the University of Hartford Summer Bridge Program to the final grade of the first academic semester math course in Hillyer College. Based on the results, a model has been developed which maps and quantifies the critical path for academic success. Program effectiveness was assessed in two dimensions: (1) Bridge Program students: (a) determination of progress made during the Bridge Program; (b) determination of relationships between the first regular semester math course grade with Δ (difference between Pre- and Post-Program test results) Math SAT scores Bridge and Non-Bridge students; (2) Comparison between Bridge and Non-Bridge students of regular semester final grades. Results show that for students who complete the Summer Bridge Program: (1) the overall mean score on the post-Program assessment is statistically significantly greater than the pre-Program assessment mean score; (2) the degree of individual student improvement demonstrated over the course of the Summer Bridge Program correlates significantly with individual first semester final grades in math; (3) the overall mean score of the first semester final grades in math for the Bridge Program cohort is statistically significantly greater than the mean score for non-Bridge students who completed the same first semester math course; the enhanced performance is equivalent to approximately a full letter grade.

AB  - This article presents a scan of the concept of "digital literacy" and discusses issues encountered in the literature, including: a) challenges in the research base for conceptualizing digital literacy, b) the multiplicity of frameworks which attempt to situate digital literacy but lack sound theoretical origins, and c) wide disagreement among stakeholder disciplines, including education, media studies, library information studies and computing/ICT studies as to what specific skills or knowledge should fall under the umbrella term of digital literacy. The review focuses on the field of education and briefly examines the inconsistent local, national, and international curriculum standards used to both instruct and assess students. It concludes with a presentation of a brief assessment tool, the Software Recognition Test, which preliminary research suggests has predictive validity for educational use and could, with further development, be used for low stakes assessment of digital literacy for K-12 or post-secondary settings. © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - Heroin addiction has a negative impact on cognitive functions, and recovering addicts suffer from cognitive impairment. Traditional cognitive rehabilitation approaches suffer from limited motivational appeal and are relatively cumbersome to carry out. We report a study testing on an alternative mHealth approach using tablets and serious games to stimulate cognitive functions. In order to test the efficacy of these methods, a small scale cognitive training program was run with a sample of male heroin addicts who were undergoing a rehabilitation program for heroin addiction as inpatients at a local NGO. The results were promising and highlight the need for randomized control trials to clearly ascertain the efficacy of this alternative approach to cognitive rehabilitation programs. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - Technical Debt is a useful metaphor to explain some of the difficulties of software evolution. The concept of Technical Debt is gaining importance from a scientific perspective, as the number of related papers, special issues, and international events grow over the years. From a practical perspective, the number of tools related to Technical Debt and their industrial adoption grow as well. Despite this high interest, Technical Debt is not yet included in the software engineering curriculum and hence the greater part of students graduating in computer science or software engineering does not know about Technical Debt. The aim of this paper is to discuss the inclusion of Technical Debt in the software engineering curriculum. We claim that Technical Debt should be treated as a first class entity the same as Requirements Engineering, Software Design and Architecture, and Software Testing. We support our claim by presenting five reasons why Technical Debt should be included in the software engineering curriculum. © 2015 ACM.
