AB  - Computational thinking is an important skill for solving complex problems, including processes such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic design. Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.

AB  - CDIO is an innovative educational concept used around the world to improve the quality of undergraduate engineering education. It is very suitable to be applied to guide the teaching reform of software testing course, which is an important part of software engineering education. Due to problems like the lack of practice in traditional software testing teaching and that of students' interest in learning, we proposed a novel CDIO-based online-offline hybrid teaching reform model for software testing course. In this reformed teaching model, guided by the CDIO educational initiative, we redesigned the course structure to adjust the teaching content, developed multiple online course practice trainings in an online curriculum resource library, and built a teaching evaluation mechanism corresponding to case-based offline teaching. This teaching reform, to a certain extent, has achieved the goal of strengthening practice, enhancing students' interest in learning, and improving their professional quality and software testing skills. This teaching practice provides reference and inspiration for the innovation and reform of software engineering education in colleges and universities.

AB  - Although testing software is paramount to safeguard our digitizing society, students are reluctant to consider a career in the field. A reason could be that dedicated courses on software testing are rare. However, even when such a course exists, students perceive testing as a boring, unrewarding and even dogmatic chore. For more than 10 years, we have been teaching a software testing course at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Driven by our belief that an abundant exposure to software bugs makes good testers, we experimented with many ideas to engage students and make them love the topic. The most unorthodox, yet effective interventions we are proud of, were: (1) to scare students by analyzing past, software-related accidents, such as Therac-25 or Boeing 737-MAX; (2) to thrill them using bug-hunting gamification, enabled by the in-house developed VU-BugZoo; (3) to trust them an end-to-end testing of safety-critical software- intensive systems, such as model trains, automatic insulin pumps and even radiotherapy facilities, and (4) to inspire their career, by opening a dialog with test professionals from industry. The result is a mature course, read yearly by 50 computer science graduates, where almost 80% of the participants find the topic interesting and challenging, and 40% consider a future carrier in testing. These positive results make us confident that we found a formula that works. In this position paper, we would like to share our innovative ideas and lessons learned. Also in the future, we will stay committed to educate enthusiastic and responsible software testers.

AB  - The ability to effectively and efficiently test software is an important practice in software testing that is often under-emphasized in computer science education. Many students find learning about testing to be uninteresting and difficult to learn. This causes numerous students to develop inadequate testing habits, which can be detrimental to their professional careers. To encourage students to develop better testing habits, we used gamification to make the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable. In this paper we explore this idea by integrating gamification and statement coverage into a turn-based game called CoverBot. To test the effectiveness of CoverBot with respect to both teaching statement coverage and increasing engagement and enjoyment, we conducted a user study. We found that gamification makes the learning about statement coverage more engaging and enjoyable while also enhancing the participants performance and understanding of statement coverage.

AB  - Software testing is a core aspect of software development, but testing programs systematically is not always a core aspect of software engineering education. As a result, software developers often treat testing as a liability, and overall software quality suffers. One of the reasons for this is that standard testing techniques are often perceived as boring and difficult when compared to creative programming and design activities, which dominate education. To make software testing education more enjoyable, we recently introduced the Code Defenders game, in which players engage with testing activities in a fun and competitive way. In this short paper, we explore the idea of using Code Defenders to systematically teach software testing concepts. We present a mapping of core developer testing concepts, such as statement or branch coverage, to categories of puzzles in the framework of the game. As players progress through levels of this game, they incrementally learn and practice testing concepts. By presenting software testing as an enjoyable activity, we hope that learners will not only acquire better testing skills, but will in the long term become better software engineers.

AB  - Software testing is a very practical course, in order to achieve the teaching requirements of professional ability training as the important target, this paper puts forward the design of blending teaching mode of software testing course from three aspects: teaching method, teaching content and teaching evaluation. Among them, online micro-video teaching is adopted before class, and offline teaching combined with the teaching mode of flipped classroom is adopted in class, running through the teaching methods of graded project-driven and case teaching, and that online recombination test paper is adopted to test students' learning effect after class. This will form a closed loop of pre-class, in-class and after-class learning, giving play to the advantages of online and offline teaching, promoting students' personalized independent learning and in-depth learning, so as to improve students' learning effect.

Over the past decades, we have built software to improve our efficiency, reliability, and safety in production, business, daily life, etc. These goals, however, cannot be accomplished if the software is not properly tested. Some universities provide classes to teach students the fundamental knowledge and techniques of software testing. However, these classes often ignore industry practices and can hardly offer real-world testing experiences to students. To address this, we partnered with industry sponsors to design and host several software testing contests along with software testing tutorials. Through the contests and tutorials, we brought real-world testing and tool experience to the students and provided excellent opportunities for them to practice their learned testing techniques to overcome industry testing challenges.

Therefore, most lectures still teach in a classic lecture format despite the fact that this way of instruction is in any case the optimal way of instruction for today's requirements anymore. In this paper we present our implementation of an active learning method to deepen the knowledge in academic software test education. We describe a card game for advanced learning that promotes students' collaboration and knowledge exchange in a playful and competitive manner. The design of the game is based on constructive and cooperative theories. A subsequent evaluation shows that the use of this card game for teaching software testing is a suitable method.

AB  - In spite of its importance to software quality, software testing is often considered the "poor man" of software engineering processes, left to the end of many projects, and frequently omitted altogether. Compounding this is the reported perception of testing as a menial, low-level job, lacking any need for creativity or ingenuity, and of much lower status and attractiveness than others, such as design and implementation. When teaching about software testing, instructors often face very unmotivated students, professing little or no interest in becoming testers. This tutorial will address some testing misconceptions, and, through Metamorphic Testing - a new approach to testing which alleviates some of the major challenges in the field (including the Oracle Problem) - will provide a fresh and exciting new perspective on software testing.

In our original paper we employed POGIL-like in an in-person classroom. In this replication study we discuss in detail the implementation of POGIL-like in a fully virtual, synchronous online classroom. We found a positive correlation between POGIL-like and student learning. We measured student learning outcomes using a cognitive pre- and post- survey instrument and observed statistically significant increases in learning outcomes. Our results reinforce the findings from our original study, and establish POGIL-like as a suitable pedagogical approach for teaching software testing and DevOps online at the undergraduate level.

AB  - This Research Full Paper presents an overview of the practices that have been used to integrate software testing into programming education. Introductory programming courses compose the core of several undergraduate programs, since programming is a crucial technical skill for professionals in many areas. Given the subject importance, researchers have been conducting several studies to investigate teaching approaches that can help overcoming students' learning difficulties. In particular, studies on introducing software testing into this context present evidence that testing practices can improve students' programming performance and habits. There are many teaching approaches in programming education, which involve different choices of programming paradigm and language, support tools and development practices, such as version control. Likewise, the integration of software testing into such diverse context can also happen in many different ways. Therefore, investigating the ways to teach programming and testing at the same time can help instructors with informed choices. In this sense, we identified teaching practices that have been adopted to integrate software testing into programming education. To do so, we further analyzed a subgroup of 195 papers that returned in our systematic mapping on this research domain. We selected papers describing empirical studies (e.g. survey, qualitative studies, experiments, case studies and experience reports), since this kind of study involves applying a given teaching practice in order to collect evidence or report the observed experience. Overall, our results shed light on how the integration of software testing has been done in different classroom contexts of programming education. We discuss the practices in terms of their application context (i.e. the course), how testing was introduced in theory and practice, and the adopted support tools. We also discuss an important gap regarding the lack of instruction in testing concepts, even when students are responsible to write their own tests.

Players compete over a Java class under test by producing tests and mutants, i.e., artificial faults, scoring points if tests reveal mutants, or mutants survive tests. While initially created as a fun way to introduce students to testing in one-off fun sessions, we have moved to integrating the game as an assessed core component of a software testing course. This has shown great potential in engaging students, but many challenges have been revealed as part of this integration. In this paper we describe how we integrated Code Defenders into a software testing course, and how we improved the game in order to address the resulting challenges.

The course does not solely entail software testing as a topic, but also addresses briefly static analysis first (i.e. before testing) and verification afterwards (i.e. after testing). This is the reason for calling it with a twist from the testing perspective a sandwich approach. We motivate and present the overall structure and format of the course w.r.t. its learning objectives. We moreover describe some illustrative examples for structured interactions with students during the lecture as well as for project assignments, putting these into perspective w.r.t. the sandwich approach.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a proposal for a model to improve the teaching process of software testing supported by elements of agile methods. It was developed to be used as a guide to support professors or specialists for decision making, selection of teaching materials according to the participants' cognitive learning for the execution of subjects or teaching units on topics related to software testing. In addition to suggesting several personalized activities, presenting an instance of application of a teaching syllabus that adheres to several reference syllabus, this model also seeks to be extensible, to be applied in other teaching areas, trying not to be limited to the software testing area. The construction of this model makes use of practical teaching approaches supported by practices, such as gamification and playful teaching to motivate and engage participants, bringing common tasks and technologies in the software industry in parallel to classic lecture classes, in order to develop certain skills, which were obtained through academic syllabus, together with technical skills in software testing for participants, in addition to knowledge of several open source tools that are used by testing professionals in the software industry. This construction is specified in several stages arranged in a teaching cycle, being sequenced when they are applied and can be adapted for other learning scenarios. Subsequently, the skills, competences and support materials that can be used are presented in addition to the possible effects expected on students from the application of this model in the teaching of software testing. As it uses practical teaching approaches, it is advisable that this model is used by professors who have a teaching facilitator profile, as it presents humanistic teaching learning, with a focus on participants and teamwork, principles found in agile methods, in which activities will have deliveries of products that approach what is performed in a software company and it will be necessary the interaction of all participants in the model. The evaluation process for this teaching model took place in two stages. First, there was an analysis and individual evaluation of the model through the questionnaire, then there was a consensus meeting between the evaluators, where they justified the marks attributed in the evaluation and their considerations on other responses. This meeting aimed to solve disagreements and collect opinions, enabling problems to be solved and reaching a final consensus among the evaluators. The authors consider that it is necessary to remodel teaching paradigms of computing subjects, using together some characteristics of traditional approaches with more practical teaching approaches that solidify the knowledge of the participants for the challenges that exist in the software industry.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the results obtained in an implementation of a flipped classroom, taught remotely synchronously in a subject of software testing in a graduate class. Due to the maintenance of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2021 due to the emergence of some variants, some universities around the world, especially in countries with a still high transmission rate, decided to continue with remote classes in this academic period. In this context, Software Testing is an important topic of knowledge derived from Software Engineering and has been gaining prominence in development companies in recent years, however it is a subject that needs a more practical and dynamic way of learning to obtain skills and competences. by the students. In order to promote a good teaching and learning process, more and more teachers and professors have been taking greater care in the selection of teaching strategies to help build the knowledge of their students, one of these strategies is the flipped classroom, in which the student internalizes the contents pointed out before a class and then, together with the class, a discussion is held about the knowledge acquired with the help and guidance of the teacher / professor. However, this knowledge transfer process has some extra difficulties with content that are more easily taught in a practical and face-to-face manner. Assuming, this work presents how the authors got around these difficulties and what the students present in a graduate class in a Software Testing subject thought of the adopted teaching strategy. To present an experience report of the use of the flipped classroom strategy in a software testing subject in a graduate computer science class. In parallel also, analyze the motivation and engagement of students in this learning scenario of the strategy in remote teaching. For this subject, a specific curriculum was selected for the teaching of software testing that takes into account the academic competences of the Brazilian Ministry of Education – MEC. Both the learning of the content were evaluated, taking into account the evaluations that were used in the flipped classroom with other teaching strategies in two other previous classes, the feedback given by the students about the subject and specifically about this teaching strategy was also considered, which was obtained via a structured questionnaire answered anonymously by each of the students participating in the course. The results indicate that there was an increase in the students' grade compared to evaluations of the same subject in the two previous years. However, the most important result was the feedback given by the students in the perception questionnaire of each teaching strategy adopted in the subject, considering that there was an excellent acceptance according to the participants. This paper mainly aims to help teachers / professors and researchers of active teaching methodologies in the perspective of knowledge construction in remote teaching using the flipped classroom as a support strategy.

AB  - This Research for the Practice of Full Paper shows that in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the immense challenge of continuing the teaching-learning process without face-to-face classes arose. This required a rapid shift to distance education in order to enable continuity of university activities. Distance education still needs the help of other factors, as some subjects, for example software testing, may need other forms of active approaches and methodologies to make their teaching and learning process more efficient. In teaching some computer science subjects, there is a need for learning through the application of practical activities. The use of distance learning entails an even greater aggravation of this need, given the numerous limitations that exist in this modality, requiring good planning and rigorous monitoring before, during and after classes. Thus, this paper aims to identify and discuss the findings, good practices, recommendations and perceptions used in a software testing subject, in addition to analyzing the motivations and perceptions of students in a distance learning environment.

AB  - In order to strengthen moral education in university, we take the course of software testing as an example to build the ideological and political teaching of first-class courses for general universities. In this paper, we organically integrate teaching content with ideological and political elements, and propose a student-centered reformation teaching mode and evaluation system. A comprehensive training model of inside and outside of class, before and after course, promoting learning by competition, and improving scientific research has gradually formed, so as to train socialist builders with both ability and political integrity and achieve a long-term training for students of different levels in and out of class. Two years' teaching practice shows that the innovative curriculum design has effectively improved the students' ideological level and political literacy and the educational function of professional courses has been effectively exerted, it forms a solid basic for further development of students.

AB  - This Research to Practice full paper presents an investigation into the construction of a software testing syllabus, using agile practices as support to make it adherent to teaching by academic skills. In most Brazilian universities, software testing is approached mainly as subtopics of the subjects of Software Engineering or Software Quality; this little contact with the topic can become a discouraging problem for higher education students seeking knowledge about this important area. For the development of the syllabus, we had as reference the competence and syllabus guidelines of the Ministry of Education of Brazil, which is the regulator of the syllabus guidelines for undergraduate and graduate courses in computing in Brazil. In conjunction with these guidelines, other assets in the area were aligned, such as the academic syllabus of the Brazilian Computer Society and the ACM / IEEE, in conjunction with the SWEBOK test-oriented knowledge areas, the Test Maturity Model Integration process areas and guided by agile practices, principles and techniques found in the literature. After this stage, the construction of teaching units for teaching of software testing was carried out. These teaching units were evaluated as part of the software testing teaching model by means a focus group, composed of three doctors who are also specialists in the teaching of software engineering, with experience in teaching and research. Thus, this work also provides a set of skills that we consider favorable to the teaching of software testing, considering several academic syllabuses analyzed. Academic program managers and teachers can use the knowledge generated in this article to facilitate the construction of syllabuses or subjects related to tests, learning objects and academic syllabus. Our findings can also be learning facilitators for competency-based teaching and learning experiences for testing professionals.

AB  - This Research Full Paper presents an analysis of the perception of research professors of Software Engineering on the use and difficulties in the context of developing classrooms with teaching strategies using active methodologies remotely. In recent years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, professors have been facing several challenges to keep students engaged, motivated and learning. The active teaching methodologies that have been collaborating in recent years in the teaching and learning process of students, needed to adapt to the remote teaching class scenario that was implemented in several universities. This research measured the point of view of four professors, who are also researchers in computing education, about how their classes behaved in the last two years of the Software Testing subject in a graduate program at a Brazilian federal university. So that computing students have a way to obtain knowledge in a more practical way so that there is a decrease in the difficulty of students adapting to the job market. Professors are increasingly adopting active methodologies, group work and practical teaching approaches in order for students to acquire skills that will be decisive for their professional future. In view of the existing pandemic scenario and the need to adapt teaching plans for remote teaching, this paper sought to identify the perceptions that professors had, whether in the difficulties of adapting activities, adapting teaching plans to difficulties in keeping students attentive and motivated in the content that was being passed on. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss professors' perceptions about the use of active teaching methodologies using remote teaching in a software testing subject of a graduate class at a Brazilian federal university. It was also analyzed how the professors dealt with the issue of student motivation and engagement at that time. An analysis of the teaching plan of the software testing subject of the last two years of the graduate program in computing at a Brazilian federal university was carried out and each of the methodologies with the perception of the professors who participated in these subjects. The collection of these data was carried out by means of an interview with the four professors, the feedback from the students of the classes on each of the adopted methodologies was also analyzed and a triangulation of the data obtained was performed. The results indicate that there were great difficulties in adapting active methodologies from the point of view of the professors, however most of these challenges were overcome in the their views. It was also pointed out that certain methodologies and practices work better if the learning is done in an evolutionary way and that takes into account the students' previous knowledge about contents, tools and practices that the professors want to use. Thus, this paper aims to present an overview of professors' perspectives on the teaching of a computing subject that needs practical approaches using active methodologies in an emergency situation of remote teaching.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents exploratory testing, an approach that has become quite relevant in the testing software, growing its application in the industrial scenario. The main reason for that is the emerging utilization of agile practices in the software development process to satisfy the needs of the market (Time to Market), which is essential for a company to remain active in the market. However, the systematic mapping study performed found few studies about the application of exploratory testing, a subject little discussed in the academic context. For this reason, this work uses gamification as a systematic strategy in exploratory test teaching and learning in the form of an experiment with two classes. One class has undergraduate students in Computer Science, and the other has students who graduated as Computer Technicians. The aim is to engage students to obtain a better performance, preparing them to use that test approach in the industrial and academic context. As a result, students achieved good overall performance; with reports from students that gamification facilitated and significantly collaborated to achieve a better performance converging with the quantitative data obtained. This can be evidenced mainly by the fact that both runs of the experiment (classes) reached a percentage higher than 70% of achievement, a great overall performance analyzed by the ratio of medals obtained by participation.

AB  - Software quality assurance and testing is a vital phase in the software development lifecycle, oftentimes requiring a significant portion of the overall development budget. Providing authentic, real-world software quality assurance and testing experiences within the context of a Computer Science or Software Engineering curriculum is challenging. Based on prior experience leveraging Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as an instructional medium for teaching Software Engineering concepts, this paper describes five increasingly involved learning interventions that utilize FOSS in a software testing course to provide students real-world hands-on software testing knowledge and experience. The proposed approach will be piloted and assessed in software testing courses at the undergraduate and graduate level.

AB  - Software testing is a relevant activity to provide evidence of qualifty of software products. However, there is a lack of qualified professionals in this area. This can be caused due to difficulty in teaching software testing through approaches that use only theoretical classes and traditional tools. In addition, there is a lack of motivation due to the work environment and the strategies of allocation and responsibility of these professionals in development and testing teams. To mitigate these problems, approaches have been used to support software testing education, such as: educational games, integrated teaching of software testing with programming, educational modules, among others. The objective of this paper was to develop an educational game named Testing Game, addressing the following topics: functional testing, structural testing and mutation testing. To support the development of the Testing Game, we performed a systematic mapping aiming at selecting a game engine. To evaluate the efficiency of the game, we conducted a feasibility study to evaluate the quality regarding motivation, user experience and learning from the point of view of the students. We also evaluate the usability of the Testing Game. Approximately 85.64% of people who participated in the study assessed the quality of the game in a positive perspective regarding motivation, user experience and learning from the point of view of the students. Regarding the usability of the game, students identified minor problems. Through this work, we realize that the game Testing Game can constitute as a complementary resource to support software testing education.

Early childhood education, especially pre-school playgroup in the age range up to the age of 6 years is a very important education in providing the basis for knowledge, attitudes and skills so that E-Learning is one of the efforts to improve the abilities of pre-school playgroup children. Therefore, gamification in E-Learning as a game application is needed to teach knowledge, attitudes and skills towards Pre-school playgroup children by playing which can train the cognitive and motor skills of the child. Game application development from ELearning will be developed using the Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC) method with Construct 3 development software. Testing will be carried out using Alpha Test and Beta Test. The results of the Alpha Test and Beta Test tests carried out by end-users stated that the system was appropriate and the features were running well. This application is expected to help Preschool playgroup students in improving their learning abilities.

AB  - Few if any would dispute that educating software engineering is a challenging endeavour. Although programming and creating new artefacts can motivate the creativity of students. Other software engineering topics (like e.g. requirement specifications and testing) are not considered very exciting by students. However, these topics are important to develop quality software and insufficient knowledge of students — Europe's future software engineers — in the long run contributes to failing software. The EU Erasmus+ project IMPRESS was set to explore the use of gamification in educating software engineering at the university level. The objective has been to develop a toolset that can help to improve students' engagement, and hence their appreciation, for the taught subjects like software testing and specifications. The proposed tutorial will guide participants through the set of tools developed by the project and introduce how they can use them to improve students' engagement.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents an investigation on the teaching of software tests in Computer Science courses in Brazilian Institutions. In this work, we investigate the existence of subjects and contents related to the software testing theme in the academic curricula of the best Brazilian universities in the computer courses indicated by Folha's Universities Ranking in 2019. So that the software testing activity becomes widespread and recognizable, it needs to be widely taught and discussed, although there is a growing concern with this teaching theme, the organization and depth of teaching software testing varies widely in each curriculum matrix of the studied institutions, especially comparing them with the curriculum of updated reference of the ACM / IEEE (Association for Computing Machinery / Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) and the curriculum guide of the SBC (Brazilian Computer Society) along with the areas of knowledge present in the SWEBOK Guide (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge), which are the main references for building of the curricula of Brazilian institutions. Thus, this work provides important inferences about how software testing has been approached, at the curricular level, in different Brazilian institutions, from specific subjetcs of software testing, subjects that contain topics related to tests and which are the main topics that are taught. Professors and academic managers can use the knowledge generated in this paper to help in a possible readjustment of how their institutions can deal with the teaching of software tests.

AB  - Today's classroom and learner cohorts are supported by new and innovative technology in an unprecedented manner. The pace of technological advancements however does present challenges to educators in keeping abreast of the state of the art while concurrently facilitating a learner-certered approach. Topics within software engineering are especially susceptible to this phenomena and demands a more individualized adaptive model to support significant learning. Although there is an abundance of sound theoretical models which may address the challenge, the literature is sparse as to contextualization, application or concrete operation. Within a blended classroom, we have implemented an adaptive approach to address the pace of technology advancements with consideration for the skillsets and declarative knowledge of the learner. In this paper we present our approach within a software testing and maintenance course and discuss the lessons learnt. We have based our approach on the scientific grounding of Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and discuss the necessary scaffolding, inherent challenges and present an evaluation based on pre/post testing.

AB  - Well-trained software development personnel, in the art and science of software testing, will effectively and efficiently develop quality software products with potentially fewer, less-critical defects. Thus software testing education is considered to be an important part of curricula for a university degree in Computer Science or Information Systems. The objective of this paper is to determine how much dedicated knowledge in the field of software testing is taught within Swedish universities. To achieve this objective, a systematic search of syllabi for software testing-related courses was done. From 25 Swedish universities offering Computer Science (or related) degrees, 14 currently offer dedicated courses in software testing. Some findings include: 32% of the individual courses were offered at the undergraduate level; 28% of the universities offer courses for specialised testing training; and, for the vast majority of the universities, dedicated software testing courses account for about 5% of the total degree credits. While some universities fare better than others, the overall state of academic software testing education in Sweden is limited but promising.

AB  - Software testing is a relevant activity to provide evidencies of the quality of software products. However, few courses in the computing area provide an adequate body of knowledge to the students and few of them pursue the software development practices and activities related to VV&T (Verification, Validation, and Testing), specifically testing, leading to a recognized lack of professionals that master the underlying VV&T concepts and principles. In this paper, we provide an overview concerning the software testing education in the most relevant brazilian universities and abroad. We analyze the reference curricula proposed by SBC (Brazilian Computer Society) and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) for undergraduate computer courses as well as the curricula of the most relevant universities in Brazil and abroad. We identify the effort allocated, the main approaches and the main tendencies to facilitate the teaching of software testing. It is clear that there is a need to integrate software testing education with other disciplines along the CS undergraduate courses.

AB  - This Full Paper (Research) presents an analysis on the competences in software testing for the fresh graduates in computer science. Software Testing education (ST) is receiving increasing attention in literature, recent studies have evaluated instructional methods used in ST education. However, analysis of competences (skills, knowledge, and ability) required in ST education are lacking in literature. Competences play critical roles in curriculum development e.g., they inform the design of student learning outcomes, learning objectives and program outcomes. This full paper in the research category aims to analyze competences in ST education and then examine the gap between these competences and the current ST curriculum. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we collect 2033 job descriptions from three popular job portals (indeed, monster, and career builder) in the USA and Canada. Also, we collected course syllabi from 20 universities offering ST courses and use these to assess the current curriculum in ST. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis and found that the current software testing curricula do not always teach or equip students with some of the soft skills they require to be successful in software testing career. For instance, our result shows that soft skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership, which are often required by software testing employers are not always taught in ST courses.

AB  - Teaching software testing can be challenging due to low student interest, high cognitive load, and lack of alignment with industry needs. Previous research has attempted to address these challenges by using mutation testing, which involves intentionally introducing faults into the code to measure the ability of a test suite to detect faults. Although this method has been proven effective in teaching software testing, it can sometimes be difficult for a novice to write a test to kill some mutants because they are too subtle and there are no hints. In contrast, extreme mutation testing involves more evident changes (e.g., removing a method body) that may be easier for novice testers to identify. This paper investigates extreme mutation testing as an alternative to teaching software testing by comparing it to regular mutation testing in an empirical evaluation with two undergraduate classes. Our results show that both can help teach software testing, with regular mutation testing slightly more effective, and both types of reports were considered clear by a similar number of students.

AB  - Spiral Learning aims to strengthen students' understanding of the basic concepts by revisiting the concepts periodically with different contexts and with increasing sophistication throughout the curriculum. This approach helps to overcome the limitations of the instructional design and delivery such as concepts taught in isolation and not being emphasized in later stages of learning leading to poor appreciation of learned concepts and repetition disregarding earlier knowledge limiting the depth of treatment. Software testing is an important skill required for computer science and engineering professionals. Students are able to write quality programs only if they know what is to be tested. Earlier, “software testing” was taught as a course in higher semester of undergraduate (UG) curriculum of computer science and engineering. As it was taught in isolation it was difficult for to build up required testing skill in the students. This paper discusses the experience of authors in building software testing skills among the students of engineering degree program in computer science and engineering as a solution to make up for the deficiency in the earlier curriculum. Authors explain the need for building software testing skills seamlessly integrating with programming, software engineering and project courses through spiral approach.

AB  - Writing good software tests is difficult, not every software developer's favorite occupation, and not a prominent aspect in programming education. However, human involvement in testing is unavoidable: What makes a test good is often down to intuition; what makes a test useful depends on an understanding of the program context; what makes a test find bugs depends on understanding the intended program behaviour. Because the consequences of insufficient testing can be dire, this paper explores a new angle to address the testing problem: Gamification is the approach of converting potentially tedious or boring tasks to components of entertaining gameplay, where the competitive nature of humans motivates them to compete and excel. By applying gamification concepts to software testing, there is potential to fundamentally change software testing in several ways: First, gamification can help to overcome deficiencies in education, where testing is a highly neglected topic. Second, gamification engages practitioners in testing tasks they would otherwise neglect, and gets them to use advanced testing tools and techniques they would otherwise not consider. Finally, gamification makes it possible to crowdsource complex testing tasks through games with a purpose. Collectively, these applications of gamification have the potential to substantially improve software testing practice, and thus software quality.

AB  - The International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) is a widely-recognized organization that provides a certification scheme in the field of software testing. The knowledge this scheme sets for different levels and areas of software testing has become a standard terminology and requirement for software testers in the industry. In the first part of this paper, in a small survey, we examine the importance of certification in the industry, then we do a literature review to investigate to what extent the ISTQB material is used in university curricula. We examined job-offering portals and discovered that LinkedIn and Jobline mostly had job listings that favored the certificate, however, many jobs required the same skills and knowledge that the ISTQB Foundation Level certificate provides. Therefore, we recommend that universities include software testing in their computer science curriculum and accommodate the principles outlined by ISTQB. In the last part of the paper, we highlight the challenges of using ISTQB material in education based on our experience and show some possible solutions to overcome them. In conclusion, by providing sufficient knowledge, universities can provide an opportunity for students and companies to save time spent on post-graduate training for test-related positions.

AB  - Software testing is a critical component of any software development lifecycle, but becoming an experienced software tester requires understanding many strategies for writing high-quality test cases and a significant amount of practice. Situated learning theory suggests that students should be exposed to things they would see in a professional workplace. In terms of software testing, students should be exposed to real-world software testing practices in a variety of contexts, from the simplest of programs to the very complex. The goal of this paper is to share our experience integrating software testing into our undergraduate curriculum at North Carolina State University. In this paper, we discuss how software testing is taught in our CS1 - Introductory Programming, CS2 - Software Development Fundamentals, and several other courses beyond CS2. Over the past 10 years of teaching software testing in introductory programming courses, we discuss lessons learned and highlight open concerns for future research.

AB  - Many educators face problems with integrating testing into programming education. For instance: existing courses are already fully packed; testing requires skills that students might not yet have; and testing is, although considered important, not always given priority by students. Educators, in general, do not have time to overhaul a programming course to fully integrate testing, resulting in a situation in which the improvement of testing education seems to have slowed down. In this paper, we propose Test Informed Learning with Examples (TILE), a new concept to create test-awareness in introductory programming courses. TILE aims to introduce testing as early as possible and in a subtle way. As a result, integration into existing curricula can be done seamlessly and requires less effort than completely overhauling existing programming courses. The contributions of this paper are: the presentation of TILE; experiences of having applied this method in the classroom; and an open repository with assignments using our approach. Applying TILE seems to be a promising approach to introduce testing in early programming. Moreover, some TILEs can be added to existing courses with almost no effort from day one. More research is needed to gain confidence in the benefits of using TILE over time and to collect evidence that we reached the final aim of TILE, i.e. students that test because that inherently belongs to programming, and not because it is explicitly asked from them.

AB  - Testing is an indispensable part of software development. However, a career in software testing is reported to be unpopular among technology students. This can potentially create a shortage of testers in the software industry in the future. The question is, whether the perception that undergraduate students have about software testing is accurate and whether it differs from the experience reported by those who work in testing activities in the software development industry. We obtained 63 answers from practitioners in the software industry, and previous surveys analyzed the perceptions of 648 students from software engineering. This investigation demonstrates that a career in software testing is more exciting and rewarding, as reported by professionals working in the field, than students may believe. Therefore, in order to guarantee a workforce focused on software quality, the academy and the software industry need to work together to better inform students about software testing and its essential role in software development. In particular, courses in testing automation are expected to increase the popularity of the area among students.

AB  - This study examines to what extent the testing of traditional software components and machine learning (ML) models fundamentally differs or not. While some researchers argue that ML software requires new concepts and perspectives for testing, our analysis highlights that, at a fundamental level, the specification and testing of a software component are not dependent on the development process used or on implementation details. Although the software engineering/computer science (SE/CS) and Data Science/ML (DS/ML) communities have developed different expectations, unique perspectives, and varying testing methods, they share clear commonalities that can be leveraged. We argue that both areas can learn from each other, and a non-dual perspective could provide novel insights not only for testing ML but also for testing traditional software. Therefore, we call upon researchers from both communities to collaborate more closely and develop testing methods and tools that can address both traditional and ML software components. While acknowledging their differences has merits, we believe there is great potential in working on unified methods and tools that can address both types of software.

AB  - For the Sustainable Development Goal measure of Quality Education, the 2019 Global Education Monitoring Report by UNESCO highlighted that there are a limited set of measures to monitor digital literacy skills as compared to financial literacy skills. Furthermore, the United Nation's International Telecommunication Union report shows that across countries, digital skills such as programming skills remains unpopular. Understanding this challenge, the researchers from MIMOS Berhad, Malaysia propose that Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V) Software Testing skill be measured by UNESCO as it is a natural progression in terms of skills enhancements towards programming skills. In partnership with the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development, MIMOS Berhad designed a practical oriented fundamental IV&V Software Testing syllabus for Malaysian working in Small and Medium Enterprise and conducted a training. As a measure of digital literacy skills, a statistically significant improvement from 48.26% to 73.43% average score in IV&V Software Testing skills was observed. By employing a Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Signed-Rank Test, results revealed that the null hypothesis of “no statistically significant differences between SME worker's digital knowledge level in terms of IV&V Software Testing examination score” can be rejected , Z= -5.449, p <; 0.05. Moving forward, an intermediate and advanced level course in software automation testing may be conducted.

AB  - In the age of artificial intelligence (A.I.), software engineering is facing unprecedented changes. Software developers need to have a deep understanding of, especially large model technologies, since the traditional software development model cannot meet the new needs. Moreover, software engineering also needs to pay more attention to the value of data. The data-driven software development models are growing, and data analysis and machine learning technologies have also been widely used. Software development requires higher efficiency, quality, and flexibility. New methods such as agile development and DevOps have emerged. Software testing also needs to be more intelligent, and test automation has become an essential part in software engineering. This speech focuses on sharing the opportunities and challenges brought by GPT and other big models to software development and testing. It also looks forward to the changes brought by A.I. to software engineering education and how we coped. The reform of software engineering is an inevitable trend, and software developers need to constantly learn new technologies and master new methods in the age of A.I.

AB  - Over the past decade, predictive language modeling for code has proven to be a valuable tool for enabling new forms of automation for developers. More recently, we have seen the ad-vent of general purpose "large language models", based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text, which includes code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end users.The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with answering common questions in a popular software testing curriculum. We found that given its current capabilities, ChatGPT is able to respond to 77.5% of the questions we examined and that, of these questions, it is able to provide correct or partially correct answers in 55.6% of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 53.0% of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a marginally higher rate of correct answers and explanations. Based on these findings, we discuss the potential promises and perils related to the use of ChatGPT by students and instructors.

AB  - Software testing is one of the crucial supporting processes of software life cycle. Unfortunately for the software industry, the role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to the treatment of the testing role within the software industry. The present study aims to analyse this situation to explore what might inhibit an individual from taking up a software testing career. In order to investigate this issue, we surveyed 132 senior students pursuing a degree in computer science and information and communication technology (ICT) related areas at three universities in the United Arab Emirates: UAE University in Al Ain, Sharjah University in Sharjah and New York University in Abu Dhabi. The students were asked to describe the PROs and CONs of taking up a career in software testing, and to describe the likelihood that they would take up the career themselves. The study identified 7 main PROs and 9 main CONs for pursuing a testing career, and indicated that the role of software tester is perceived as a social role, which may require as many soft skills as technical knowledge. The results also show that the UAE students have a stronger negative attitude towards software testing than do their counterparts where similar investigations have been carried out in different countries in the past three years.

AB  - Software testing is being leveraged in programming education for automated assessment of programming assignments. When using software testing in programming education, program specifications are provided as unit or integration tests, and students create programs that pass these tests. Although this method has various advantages, such as ensuring objective program specifications and automating the operation check, it also has many disadvantages. For example, detecting innovations, such as original specifications and functional extensions by an individual student, is difficult. The purpose of this research is to automatically detect functional differences among student programs in programming education using tests. In our proposed method, automatic test generation is applied to student programs, and the generated tests are mutually executed for other student programs. Furthermore, we classify the tests based on the execution path to obtain sets of tests that are capable of detecting functional differences.

AB  - This paper describes our experience using Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) in a graduate Software Testing course during two semesters. JiTT is a pedagogical strategy that bridges in-class and out-of-class components through preparatory web-based assignments, known as warm-ups. Our JiTT design was as follows. The preparatory out-of-class component consisted of a reading test, which required students to read a chapter from the textbook and then answer a web-based test available in our virtual platform. Reading tests were due the day before class in order to give the teacher enough time to read over the student's responses and adjust the next lesson accordingly. The in-class component was organized around student common misconceptions or difficulties, extracted from the reading tests submitted by the students. Discussions and cooperative learning activities were among the teaching strategies used in class. Our approach was assessed from the students' and teacher's perspective. The students' perspective was obtained from a survey. The teacher's perspective consisted in an assessment of strengths and limitations. Results from our evaluation show that a vast majority of students believe their learning improves when they prepare for class by reading the material in advance. They also think that reading tests are an effective way of verifying that students did the assigned reading. Most of them also consider that JiTT is an appropriate teaching strategy for the course. From the teacher's perspective, a major strength found was that students were more engaged in class, asking interesting questions that enriched class discussion. Also, the use of open-ended (essay-type) questions in reading tests has the additional benefit of helping them become better writers (organize their ideas better and clarify their thinking through writing)

AB  - Software testing is a complex, intellectual activity based (at least) on analysis, reasoning, decision making, abstraction and collaboration performed in a highly demanding environment. Naturally, it uses and allocates multiple cognitive resources in software testers. However, while a cognitive psychology perspective is increasingly used in the general software engineering literature, it has yet to find its place in software testing. To the best of our knowledge, no theory of software testers' cognitive processes exists. Here, we take the first step towards such a theory by presenting a cognitive model of software testing based on how problem solving is conceptualized in cognitive psychology. Our approach is to instantiate a general problem solving process for the specific problem of creating test cases. We then propose an experiment for testing our cognitive test design model. The experiment makes use of verbal protocol analysis to understand the mechanisms by which human testers choose, design, implement and evaluate test cases. An initial evaluation was then performed with five software engineering master students as subjects. The results support a problem solving-based model of test design for capturing testers' cognitive processes.

AB  - This paper attempts to understand motivators and de-motivators that influence the decisions of software professionals to take up and sustain software testing careers across four different countries, i.e. Canada, China, Cuba, and India. The research question can be framed as "How many software professionals across different geographies are keen to take up testing careers, and what are the reasons for their choices?" Towards that, we developed a cross-sectional but simple survey-based instrument. In this study we investigated how software testers perceived and valued what they do and their environmental settings. The study pointed out the importance of visualizing software testing activities as a set of human-dependent tasks and emphasized the need for research that examines critically individual assessments of software testers about software testing activities. This investigation can help global industry leaders to understand the impact of work-related factors on the motivation of testing professionals, as well as inform and support management and leadership in this context.

AB  - Software testing, as part of the software quality assurance processes in software engineering (SE), is seldom cited as the most engaging part of a software engineer's training. In spite of its importance, it was often a neglected area, and only recently, with the adoption of more agile methodologies, has testing come to the fore. Testers face challenges, including the need to be able to identify when software is not behaving as expected. Metamorphic Testing (MT) first appeared twenty years ago in an effort to help testers facing the oracle problem (not having a mechanism to determine correct software behavior). Although MT is simple in concept, it has demonstrated very impressive fault-finding ability, and has recently been attracting a great deal of interest. Training students and practitioners to effectively apply MT has become an important goal, but to date, no textbook or guidelines have been made readily available. This paper, written by some of the leading voices in the MT community, is a sharing of some of the experiences, reflections and insights gained through teaching MT (and other related subjects). These experiences indicate that not only is MT effective in industry and at fault-finding, it has the potential to really engage students in creative SE classroom activities.

Unfortunately, this topic is usually taught in a theoretical way. Students hardly use this approach in their projects. In this paper, we present a simple software development workflow that seamlessly integrates requirements refinement, object-oriented design, and test-driven development. A step-by-step live-coding demonstration which resembles test-driven development tasks students will face in the industry is also provided. By adopting the workflow and exemplary project in a programming class, we hope this provides students with some hands-on experience, thus helping develop good habit of programming.

AB  - Due the constant evolution of software development and its growing complexity, more is being required from professionals to master different phases of the software development process, which includes the testing phase. This has an impact on the training of new professionals, since the undergraduate curricula is supposed to address this complexity. In this sense, software testing has its place in undergraduate CS-related courses, still the literature points out that the needed attention and importance is not given by the students and even by academic curricula. One of the possible causes that can be mentioned is the way of offering this content, which is usually part of a Software Engineering introductory course, perceived by students as something tedious and not important for their career. Thinking about this scenario, this paper describes the design and implementation of Testable.

AB  - This Research Full Paper presents that nowadays it can see the growing evolution of the software development process, making agile methodologies commonly used. In this context, exploratory testing stands out as an alternative used in the industry to meet the needs of agile and / or short-term testing processes. However, professionals use this agile testing approach in an unstructured way, and this may be because they don't really understand how to apply it strategically where they can involve design and execution activities. In this context, this paper aims to present an approach that allows to apply the teaching of design and execution activities of exploratory test following structured procedures and aligned to the curricula (Brazilian and international) of the software engineering together with relevant practices in the industry. This study originates from a literature review, where important gaps are perceived to address exploratory testing education regarding design and execution activities. This involves the need to map the assets present in the curricula of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and the Association for Machinery and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer (ACM / IEEE), as well as being guided by the practices prescribed in the TMMi, by have a process area dedicated to these activities. In addition, we highlight the importance of having conducted interviews with professionals to identify tools, techniques and work products commonly used in the industry so that all this supports the alignment between academic and industrial context. In this way, it was possible to develop a consistent program of studies that allowed the construction of a teaching plan involving active pedagogical practices so that students can "learn by doing" in a more interactive way, that is, provide a student-centered teaching and learning in order to make such an approach more beneficial to the student, conditioning them to obtain the competences and abilities expected in the industry.

AB  - With the rapid development of the software industry in recent years, the demand for software testing talents in the society is also growing. Therefore, more and more colleges and universities set up "software testing technology" courses in related majors. Finding defects is a basic skill of software testing technology training. Some defects are difficult to find and some defects are easy to find. How to give reasonable evaluation according to the difficulty and quantity of defects in the defect report submitted by students often requires much of teacher's time and effort. This paper proposes a defect repetitive detection method based on the combination of TF-IDF and cosine similarity and proposes a defect report scoring mechanism based on the difficulty level and number of defects found by students. Comparing the manually scores of the defect reports by the teachers, the scoring mechanism is reasonable and effective, and greatly improves the work efficiency of the teachers.

AB  - Software testing is generally acknowledged to be an important weapon in the arsenal of software engineers to produce correct and reliable software systems. However, given the importance of the topic, little is known about where software engineers get their testing knowledge and skills from. Is this through (higher) education, training programmes in the industry, or rather is it self-taught? In this paper, we investigate the curricula of 100 highly ranked universities and survey 51 software engineers to shed light on the state-of-the-practice in software testing education, in terms of both academic education and education of software engineers in the industry.

AB  - A demonstration of the application and contribution of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in the student learning experience in the context of a Software Engineering course. Background: Software testing is an activity for ensuring software quality. Although teaching testing rigorously to students is a priority in academia, undergraduate students often encounter difficulties performing testing tasks effectively. Intended Outcomes: To increase satisfaction rate and course grades, and reduce delivery time. Application Design: We experimented with the Software Engineering Laboratory (LES) course of a Private University in the Bachelor of Computer Science and Information Systems courses. This experiment corroborated the learning difficulties of students. Collected data were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: Backed up with statistical tests, the results showed a reduction in student absences, higher student satisfaction rate, and higher grades in the courses. Furthermore, our approach allowed students to deliver a product in a short period, representing a possibility of adoption of BDD due to their successful learning experience. Finally, we aim to foster a discussion of appropriate teaching methods of software testing.

AB  - Increasing the effectiveness of programming education has emerged as an important goal in teaching programming languages in the last decade. Automatic evaluation of the correctness of the student’s source code saves teachers time and effort and allows a more comprehensive focus on the preparation of assignments with integrated feedback. The study aims to present an approach that will enable effective testing of students’ source codes within object-oriented programming courses while minimising the demands on teachers when preparing the assignment. This approach also supports variability in testing and preventing student cheating. Based on the principles of different types of testing (black-box, white-box, grey-box), an integrated solution for source code verification was designed and verified. The basic idea is to use a reference class, which is assumed to be part of every assignment, as the correct solution. This reference class is compared to the student solution using the grey-box method. Due to their identical interface (defined by assignment), comparing instance states and method outputs is a matter of basic programming language mechanisms. A significant advantage is that a random generation of test cases can be used in such a case, while the rules for their generation can be determined using simple formulas. The proposed procedure was implemented and gradually improved over 4 years on groups of bachelor students of applied informatics with a high level of acceptance.

AB  - Graduates are expected to be able to provide holistic solutions, capable of meeting diverse objectives simultaneously. Furthermore, opportunities are often “found” or “made.” The quality of solutions, however, is mediated by different conceptualizations of contexts. Thus, we aim to investigate how students would conceptualize, make sense, desire to know, find solutions and subsequently progress to collaborate, communicate and create new artefacts. We hypothesize that there would be a higher likelihood of better quality design process, explanations as well as modelling outcomes if first, students can relate between the ability to analyse problems with the ability to conceptualize/model and second, the design of the task focuses on not only functional but more importantly sustaining positive user experience. Findings highlight the importance of key design factors contributing to more creative outcomes.

AB  - Testing is a crucial activity in the development of software systems. With the increasing complexity of software projects, the industry requires incorporating graduates with adequate testing skills and preparation in this field. A challenge in software testing education is to make students perceive the benefits of writing tests and assess their quality with advanced testing techniques. In this paper, we present an experience integrating both mutation testing and self/peer assessment - two of the most used techniques to that end in the past - into a software testing course during three years. This experience allowed us to analyze the effect of applying these strategies on the students' perception of their manually-written test suites. Noticeably, the computation of the mutation score significantly undermined the initial expectations they had on the developed test suites. Also, the application of peer testing helped them estimate the relative quality of two comparable test suites, as we found a notable correspondence with their respective mutation coverage. Besides, a more in-depth analysis revealed that the students' test suites with more test cases did not always achieve the highest scores, that they found more readable their own tests, and that they tended to cover the basic operations while forgetting about more advanced features. An opinion survey confirmed the impact that the use of mutants had on their perception about testing, and they mostly supported paying a higher level of attention to testing concepts in software engineering degree plans.

AB  - In this Research Full paper, we present the results of a replication study in a semester-long, sophomore-level software engineering course utilizing Peer Instruction (PI). PI is an active learning pedagogy with roots in STEM Education. In this study, we examine the relationship between student response data from in-class PI correctness and students' performance on quizzes and exams. We worked with a fully remote, synchronous course offered over Zoom. The study we replicated was with an honors cohort of students with a diversity of undergraduate majors, while we focused on a non-honors course containing computing-related majors. Our intervention design included a flipped-classroom approach for each class session with required readings, reading quizzes, followed by PI in class using online breakout rooms for peer discussion. Our course modules were heavily based on industry practices and knowledge from the workforce, across several varied modules that encompass the complete software development lifecycle, and were as follows: Software Process Models (SPM), Software Architecture (SA), Databases (DB), User Interface/user Experience (UI/UX), Software Testing (ST), and Continuous Integration (CI). Our data points for analysis with fine-grained PI student response data were two-fold: scores from weekly online quizzes, and a summative final exam, administered online through a course management system (CMS), at different points during the semester after the PI sessions. The online quizzes and the online exam were timed, closed book/notes, and conducted during class periods. We analyzed and classified individual student responses before and after each question in each module and attempted to create response patterns for each module. We correlated these response patterns with exam and quiz scores using ANOVA techniques, on a variety of questions including Parson's problems. We report overall correctness on each type of vote, track student response patterns from in-class to quizzes and the exam, and quantify absolute percentages of students that demonstrate longer-term learning from the PI process. Our results show that 58% of students exhibited cognitive gains across all modules during PI sessions. Students who learn in class from PI perform well on the quizzes and the final exam, indicating persistence of the knowledge gained during PI several weeks after the actual sessions. We also found that those who fail to learn from the PI process in the class perform worse on quizzes and the final exam. Our results were consistent across all modules. More significantly, we found PI to be an effective way to teach our software engineering course based on student learning before and after PI, in a completely virtual environment, a result unique to our study. Based on our results, we discuss the implications for software engineering education, both in-person and virtual.

AB  - Several studies suggest that the teaching of software testing should begin as early as possible, since introductory programming courses. In this way, the teaching of both subjects, programming and testing, becomes an integrated teaching approach. Testing practices in this context can provide a timely feedback to students while they are still working on programming assignments and, as a result, increase the quality of their code. Besides, developing students' testing skills earlier is useful to improve their programming skills as well, since both kinds of skills are complementary. However, this integration is not straightforward, because lecture hours and the coverage of programming topics must remain the same, while testing concepts and practices are introduced. For this reason, when designing an educational approach to introduce testing practices to novice programmers, there is also the need to address potential difficulties faced by both students and instructors. Considering this scenario, this paper aims at identifying the challenges raised due to the integration of software testing into introductory programming courses. The goal is to provide support for instructors who intend to adopt the integrated approach. The challenges have been identified from the results of a systematic mapping we conducted of the literature in this domain. The main contribution of this paper refers to the establishment of a catalog of challenges faced to integrate software testing into introductory programming courses. We also discuss possible solutions to design courses using the integrated approach and point out challenges that have been scarcely addressed in the literature. Finally, we indicate directions that can be explored in future educational empirical studies in this context.

AB  - Software Testing (ST) is one of the least known aspects of software development. Yet, software engineers often argue that it demands more than half of the costs of a software project. Thus, proper testing education is of paramount importance. In fact, the mere exposition to ST knowledge might have an impact on programming skills. In particular, it can encourage the production of more reliable code. Although this is intuitive, to the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical studies about such effects. Evidence on this matter is important to motivate - or demotivate - classical testing education. Concerned with this, we have conducted a study to investigate the possible impact of ST knowledge on the production of reliable code. Our controlled experiment involved 28 senior-level Computer Science students, 8 auxiliary functions with 92 test cases, and a total of 112 implementations. Results show that code delivered after the exposition to ST knowledge is, on average, 20% more reliable (a significant difference at the 0.01 level). Also, implementations delivered afterwards are not significantly larger in terms of lines of code. This indicates that ST knowledge can make developers produce more reliable software with no additional overhead in terms of program size.

AB  - Software testing involves probing into the behavior of software systems to uncover faults. Most testing activities are complex and costly, so a practical strategy that has been adopted to circumvent these issues is to automate software testing. There has been a growing interest in applying machine learning (ML) to automate various software engineering activities, including testing-related ones. In this paper, we set out to review the state-of-the art of how ML has been explored to automate and streamline software testing and provide an overview of the research at the intersection of these two fields by conducting a systematic mapping study. We selected 48 primary studies. These selected studies were then categorized according to study type, testing activity, and ML algorithm employed to automate the testing activity. The results highlight the most widely used ML algorithms and identify several avenues for future research. We found that ML algorithms have been used mainly for test-case generation, refinement, and evaluation. Also, ML has been used to evaluate test oracle construction and to predict the cost of testing-related activities. The results of this paper outline the ML algorithms that are most commonly used to automate software-testing activities, helping researchers to understand the current state of research concerning ML applied to software testing. We also found that there is a need for better empirical studies examining how ML algorithms have been used to automate software-testing activities.

AB  - Accidents tend to be traumatic events that one would rather forget than remember. Software testing novices at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, on the contrary, rewind the past and learn how to safeguard the future.In this paper we will present FAIL, a rather unconventional assignment that methodically investigate 13 historical software-related accidents, varying from the Ariane-5 rocket explosion to the Knight Capital trading glitch. Innovative is that software testing students use STAMP, a modern systems-theory-based accident causality model and have the possibility to interview a witness of the famous Therac-25 radiation overexposures.A recent deployment to 96 CS graduates received positive evaluations. We learned that even a lightweight, yet systematic investigation of failures (1) motivates students, by sensitizing them to the consequences of suboptimal testing, and (2) reveals key soft-skills testers need to prevent disasters, such as defensive pessimism and a strong backbone. Other, more subtle benefits of the proposed approach include (3) really-happened, instead of artificial case-studies that increase a teacher’s credibility, and (4) extraordinary test scenarios students will always remember.These results invite software engineering educators to include safety assessment elements in their curricula, and call on witnesses of software-related accidents to break the silence and share memories. Future work includes crafting a repository of heritage artifacts (narratives, videos, witness testimonies and physical replicas) to reproduce historical software-related accidents, and make it available to interested educators. Our hope is that motivated professionals will emerge, better prepared to engineer the safe software-intensive systems we all can rely on.

AB  - Software testing is one of the crucial supporting processes of the software life cycle. Unfortunately for the software industry, the role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to treatment of the role. The present study aims to analyse the situation to explore what restricts computer science and software engineering students from taking up a testing career in the software industry. To conduct this study, we surveyed 88 Pakistani students taking computer science or software engineering degrees. The results showed that the present study supports previous work into the unpopularity of testing compared to other software life cycle roles. Furthermore, the findings of our study showed that the role of tester has become a social role, with as many social connotations as technical implications.

C3 PBL builds on established collaborative project-based learning ideas that have been shown to improve retention at various institutions, by introducing collaboration that spans multiple courses in the same term. We discuss how such a collaboration between students in different courses can change the undergraduate educational experience to improve retention, community, and self-confidence. For our work we are focusing on a curriculum based approach, leveraging collaborative project-based learning experiences to affect the mindset and culture of our department. We present lessons learned from an initial pilot of C3 PBL deployed over two semesters. The pilot looks at the pairing of introductory level courses with an upper level software engineering class. The collaboration is centered on the idea of experienced students in the upper level software engineering course working with novice students from the introductory courses. The logistics explored has lead to more meaningful interaction and assessment in the second semester offering of C3 PBL.

AB  - Symbolic execution is an indispensable technique for software testing and program analysis. Path-explosion is one of the key challenges in symbolic execution. To relieve the challenge, this paper leverages the Q-learning algorithm to guide symbolic execution. Our guided symbolic execution technique focuses on generating a test input for triggering a particular statement in the program. In our approach, we first obtain the dominators with respect to a particular statement with static analysis. Such dominators are the statements that have to be visited before reaching the particular statement. Then we start the symbolic execution with the branch choice controlled by the policy in Q-learning. Only when symbolic execution encounters a dominator, it returns a positive reward to Q-learning. Otherwise, it will return a negative reward. And we update the Q-table in Q-learning accordingly. Our initial evaluation results indicate that in average more than 90% of exploration paths and instructions are reduced for reaching the target statement compared with the default search strategy in KLEE, which shows the promise of this work.

AB  - During the teaching process of college courses, prediction of students' final performance at early stages can help teachers intervene students and improve the teaching effects. In recent years, there have been some researches on predicting students' performance based on machine learning techniques. However, many existing works lack comprehensive and sufficient student data, and there is still room for improvement in the effectiveness of predictions. Moreover, many existing methods require obtaining student data of the whole semester, which are unavailable until the end of the semester. In order to alleviate the above problems, 576 students' data are collected during five years teaching of our Software Testing course. The multifaceted data consists of 39 attributes covering students' demographic information, theoretical learning activities, practical training activities and contest learning activities. Several prediction models are created based on logical regression, random forest, and convolutional neural network. Experimental studies show that with the student data available in the middle or second half of the semester, our models can effectively predict students' final performance. Furthermore, the student features that most affect the prediction results are analyzed in the experiments.

AB  - Professional Software Development (PSD) course is about the emerging profession of software engineering which involves developing, deploying, testing, and maintaining software. Currently, the Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computing Science (CS) joint degree programme of University of Glasgow (UofG) and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) carries out both PSD and Team Projects (TP) courses concurrently, where students are expected to apply the theory learnt from PSD to real-world projects in TP. TP is a practical project continuation from knowledge learnt in the PSD course. Both PSD and TP last two trimesters in parallel. This paper analyses the advantages and disadvantages of the current learning methods in PSD and TP. It is possible that there is still room for improvement in the current system. Tо further analyse the current learning system, a comparison of how the Software Engineering course is taught in other universities is also performed, from where ideas and methodology are proposed. The proposed methodology is analyzed and discussed from the suggestions or feedback of the CS students who have gone through both PSD and TP courses. The purposes are to improve the learning effectiveness of both PSD and TP courses.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) invades our world with billions of smart, interconnected devices, all programmed to make our lives easier. For educators, teaching such a vast and dynamic field is both a necessity and a challenge. IoT-relevant topics such as programming, hardware, networking and artificial intelligence are already covered in core computing curricula. Does this mean that fresh graduates are well prepared to tackle complex IoT problems? Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The problem is that IoT devices are complex systems, where software, hardware, and humans interact with each other. From this interaction, unique behavior and hazardous situations can emerge that might easily stay undetected, unless systems are analyzed as a whole. This paper presents two differently flavored courses that teach IoT using a holistic, system-centric approach. The first is a broad introduction to Pervasive Computing, focused on the intelligence of "Things". The second is an advanced course that zooms on the process of testing a software-intensive system. The key characteristics of our approach are : (1) teaching only the bare essentials (topics needed for end-to-end engineering of a smart system), (2) a strong, hands-on project component, using microcontroller-based miniature systems, inspired by real-life, and (3) a rich partnership with industry and academic idea incubators. Positive student evaluations gathered during the last five years demonstrate that such an approach brings engagement, self-confidence and realism in IoT classrooms. We believe that this success can be replicated in other courses, by shifting the focus on different IoT-relevant aspects.

AB  - This pilot study examines how students' performance has evolved in an Object-oriented (OO) programming course and contributes to the learning analytic framework for similar programming courses in university curriculum. First, we briefly introduce the research background, a novel OO teaching practice with consecutive and iterative assignments consisting of programming and testing assignments. We propose a planned quantitative method for assessing students' gains in terms of programming performance and testing performance. Based on real data collected from students who engaged in our course, we use trend analysis to observe how students' performance has improved over the whole semester. By using correlation analysis, we obtain some interesting findings on how students' programming performance correlates with testing performance, which provides persuasive empirical evidence in integrating software testing practices into an Object-oriented programming curriculum. Then, we conduct an empirical study on how students' design competencies are represented by their program code quality changes over consecutive assignments by analyzing their submitted source code in the course system and the GitLab repository. Three different kinds of profiles are found in the students' program quality in the OO design level. The group analysis results reveal several significant differences in their programming performance and testing performance. Moreover, we conduct systematical explanations on how students' programming skill improvement can be attributed to their object-oriented design competency. By performing principal component analysis on software statistical data, a predictive OO metrics suite for both students' programming performance and their testing performance is proposed. The results show that these quality factors can serve as useful predictors of students' learning performance and can provide effective feedback to the instructors in the teaching practices.

AB  - This research full paper presents a study on graduates' knowledge gaps in software testing according to industry needs. Several studies indicate that students graduate from computing programs with a knowledge gap in software testing. In this sense, we aimed to investigate in details this broader testing gap, by considering gaps in the level of testing topics. We conducted a survey with Brazilian practitioners in order to collect data (N=90). For each testing topic, knowledge gaps were calculated as the difference between what respondents' learned/practiced in undergraduate courses and what they actually applied in industry after graduating. Results provide evidence on points that could be improved in software testing education. Firstly, for all testing topics there was a negative gap on practice activities. This means that students could benefit from more testing assignments throughout the curriculum. Regarding gaps in concepts, some testing topics presented negative gaps (such as test in web applications) and others positive (such as test in aspect oriented software and mutation analysis). Therefore, results suggest that it is possible to counterbalance them in order to reduce the existing gaps. We also present respondents' opinions about their experience in software testing education and industry practices.

AB  - In Continuous Integration (CI) environments, the productivity of software engineers depends strongly on the ability to reduce the round-trip time between code commits and feedback on failed test cases. Test case prioritization is popularly used as an optimization mechanism for ranking tests by their likelihood in revealing failures. However, existing techniques are usually time and resource intensive making them not suitable to be applied within CI cycles. This paper formulates the test case prioritization problem as an online learn-to-rank model using reinforcement learning techniques. Our approach minimizes the testing overhead and continuously adapts to the changing environment as new code and new test cases are added in each CI cycle. We validated our approach on an industrial case study showing that over 95% of the test failures are still reported back to the software engineers while only 40% of the total available test cases are being executed.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents that the test design and execution activities are essential in a testing process, as they involve the identification and analysis of assets in order to develop and apply effective test cases in the discovery of incidents. In general, these activities are related to architecture, execution, and test analysis, where the TMMi (Test Maturity Model integration) prescribes a process area with many goals and practices to perform them in an organized and effective way. In the applicability of Exploratory Test (ET), most test design activities are generally not performed because many professionals understand that it is an agile test approach that does not have a systematic strategy that can be used, so only execution activities are performed based on the tester's intuition or experience. Additionally, it is observed in the specialized literature the growth in the use of E T in the industry, making it important to have a teaching-learning approach with structured activities allowing the understanding of how to apply test design and execution. Thus, this work aims to carry out a mapping to establish curricular assets to compose a syllabus aimed at teaching-learning activities of test design and execution. From this, have a basis to extract the curricular guidelines directed to the teaching-learning of E T. This is aligned with the research question: How to match assets related to knowledge on test design and execution of TMMi that adhere to the ACM/IEEE (Association for Computing Machinery / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) curriculum and the reference to training undergraduate course in Computing at SBC (Brazilian Computer Society)? The mapping took place sequentially: i) the study theme was defined, ii) the curriculum structures and their inputs to be analyzed were defined, iii) the description of each asset was identified, iv) the correspondence between the assets was made, and v) the mapping was validated using peer review. The activity “iv” was carried out based on the specific goals and practices related to the Test Design and Execution process area of TMMi to analyze the correlation of assets present in the SBC and ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines. As a result, correspondence was generated on two levels, as follows: a) Training axes (SBC) and knowledge areas (ACM/IEEE) related to the test design and execution area of TMMi, b) Derived skills and contents (SBC), as well as topics and learning outcomes (ACM/IEEE) related to specific goals, specific practices and sub-practices of the TMMi process area. In general, the items listed above were identified, respectively, 13 assets and 110 items of assets adhering to the guidelines prescribed in the international and national curriculum for Test Design and Execution. The mapping encourages the development of a teaching plan focused on teaching and learning of ET design and execution, as there is a strong adherence of assets and their corresponding items with academic and industry practices. Such mapping should support the application of specific guidelines to ET.

AB  - Gamification is one of the new trend in software development and it has already gained a well-deserved popularity in finance, healthcare, education and even manufacturing. Software testing is a continuous cycle layered with several stages and spanning across multiple types of testing. Teams need to design test suites and implement test execution methodologies in each stage of development. For this reason, software testing teams comprise many individuals skilled in different aspects of software testing. The inclusion of gamification in this course can lead to positive benefits based on the idea that it is used to influence behavior. This paper presents an preliminary study of Machine Learning (ML) approach for predicting performance gamification of software tester specialists under a gamified testing environment. ImonaGame is a software company that delivers gamification as a service for software testing team of 30 members with different static and dynamic data. User behavior collected in dynamic data sets was classified into categories by deconstructing complex activities into behavior chains using supervision of domain experts. The classification approach was centered on the system’s testing processes’ performance objectives and potential for encouragement or dissuasion. Motivators and obstacles for the target activity and its behaviors will be found when the model has been developed. After conducting preliminary research, it is possible to determine whether gameful design is an effective and efficient tactic for achieving the desired result by analyzing needs, motives, and obstacles. The source data was classified target data in four categories such as I: Static feature (personal information; 4), II: Daily feature (gamification elements; 14), III: Mission feature (points; 7 sources) and IV: Cumulative futures (Sum of daily and mission features; 13).

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents that the Exploratory Test (ET) is evidenced in the specialized literature as an alternative used in the industry to meet the needs of agile and / or short-term test processes. However, there is still an understanding by professionals in the field that this agile test approach is informal, not considering the realization, mainly, of a strategy that can encompass ET project activities and execution in a systematic way. It is noted that the industry has been spreading the ET due to proposing an efficacy for quick feedback of the test process and not requiring great effort in documentation. However, the applicability of ET still faces challenges related to the definition of an adequate and effective strategy, mainly, to the design and execution of this approach. In view of this, this study aims to identify tools, techniques and / or methods, and work products relevant to ET design and execution activities used by professionals in the field in the industrial context adhering to the practices and goals prescribed in the TMMi (Test Maturity Model Integration). For this, a Survey was applied, by means of the interview technique with implementing professionals and / or evaluators of MPT.Br (Brazilian Testing Process Improvement), certified by TMMi and professionals without accreditation, as long as they are active in the Software Testing area, mainly with process improvement. The results were organized into three groups: 1) identification of the participants, 2) identification of tools, techniques and / or methods, and work products in the context of the ET design, and 3) identification of tools, techniques and / or methods, and work products in the context of ET execution. Thus, in group “1” all participants had more than 5 years of experience in Software Testing and with the ET approach, having their first contact with ET in the work environment or study on their own. In group “2” the Testlink and Jira tools are most used to support project activities, with risk analysis being the most cited technique for activities to identify and prioritize conditions and data for the test, also serving as a complement to the application of ET. As for work products, the most cited were the use of the test plan and results of previous test runs in which the ET was applied. In group “3”, the Mantis and Jira tools were most cited to support the management and execution of the tests. Regarding the execution techniques, the use of ET with manual and automated strategy is noted, and in relation to the work products, the incidents report and matrix were the most cited. It is noted that a tool serves many activities related to the design and execution of ET, with risk analysis being a widely used technique and incident reports being important in the analysis to make decisions regarding the testing process. Finally, it is mentioned that this work together with another study previously carried out on the identification of assets in the international and Brazilian curricula for the use of teaching-learning test design and execution will serve to support the elaboration of a ET teaching plan.

AB  - Flaky tests are test cases that can pass or fail without code changes. They often waste the time of software developers and obstruct the use of continuous integration. Previous work has presented several automated techniques for detecting flaky tests, though many involve repeated test executions and a lot of source code instrumentation and thus may be both intrusive and expensive. While this motivates researchers to evaluate machine learning models for detecting flaky tests, prior work on the features used to encode a test case is limited. Without further study of this topic, machine learning models cannot perform to their full potential in this domain. Previous studies also exclude a specific, yet prevalent and problematic, category of flaky tests: order-dependent (OD) flaky tests. This means that prior research only addresses part of the challenge of detecting flaky tests with machine learning. Closing this knowledge gap, this paper presents a new feature set for encoding tests, called Flake16. Using 54 distinct pipelines of data preprocessing, data balancing, and machine learning models for detecting both non-order-dependent (NOD) and OD flaky tests, this paper compares Flake16 to another well-established feature set. To assess the new feature set's effectiveness, this paper's experiments use the test suites of 26 Python projects, consisting of over 67,000 tests. Along with identifying the most impactful metrics for using machine learning to detect both types of flaky test, the empirical study shows how Flake16 is better than prior work, including (1) a 13% increase in overall F1 score when detecting NOD flaky tests and (2) a 17% increase in overall F1 score when detecting OD flaky tests.

AB  - The recent release of ChatGPT conversational agent has been a surprise to me, and to many of my colleagues from the software engineering community. Progress goes extremely fast, while it appears to be a true "game-changing" technology that can even generate programs and fix bugs. Machine Learning (ML) provides engineers with the prospect of producing data-driven software, with little manual code writing. These ML-enabled software bring us to a new era where systems’ logic is automatically produced from data, with a small amount of human-written code. Would we trust such software mixing ML and regular code, would you rely on it and under which conditions? This is still too early to answer these questions, and a challenging direction to explore.This radical change questions the way software are engineered, validated, secured, deployed and maintained. The overall challenge is thus to automate these activities accounting for the statistical nature of ML-enabled software.Taking a software engineering perspective, and starting from a concrete case from the finance industry, the presentation will focus on testing and robustifying a ML model which is integrated in a larger software system that takes as input domain objects (e.g. financial transaction, malware, network traffic). One traditional way to robustify a ML model consists in generating adversarial inputs, e.g. leading to a misclassification, and retraining the model. Indeed, despite their impressive performance, ML models are sensitive to small perturbations in the input. The resulting adversarial inputs raise multiple questions about the robustness of such systems, especially in safety- and business-critical domains. However, the generation of feasible, exploitable adversarial test examples is challenging, as they must satisfy the business logic constraints over the feature space. We analyse the limitations of current adversarial approaches and explore new algorithms that combine multi-objective search with constraint-solving techniques. While the attack part is the offensive weapon, we also consider the challenge to efficiently shield (e.g. repair) the systems against such threats, and finally end the seminar by mentioning other research directions to deploy robust ML-enabled systems.

AB  - When testing software it has been shown that there are substantial benefits to be gained from approaches which exercise unusual or unexplored interactions with a system - techniques such as random testing, fuzzing, and exploratory testing. However, such approaches have a drawback in that the outputs of the tests need to be manually checked for correctness, representing a significant burden for the software engineer. This paper presents a strategy to support the process of identifying which tests have passed or failed by combining clustering and semi-supervised learning. We have shown that by using machine learning it is possible to cluster test cases in such a way that those corresponding to failures concentrate into smaller clusters. Examining the test outcomes in cluster-size order has the effect of prioritising the results: those that are checked early on have a much higher probability of being a failing test. As the software engineer examines the results (and confirms or refutes the initial classification), this information is employed to bootstrap a secondary learner to further improve the accuracy of the classification of the (as yet) unchecked tests. Results from experimenting with a range of systems demonstrate the substantial benefits that can be gained from this strategy, and how remarkably accurate test output classifications can be derived from examining a relatively small proportion of results.
