# *Coding System*

aka, taking notes of what my thought process behind certain things so I don't have to make stuff from the beginning later and can explain stuff to Professor Ana

## *How I've Coded Things*

### Folders
The folder name format is as follows.

```
month day, database name, query used
```

### Document Marking
File names are marked on the beginning of their name with a **[LABEL]**. Here's the system I used, *solely based on the paper's title* (at most, it might consider the abstract if two papers have similar titles).

* **[MARKED]**: means I have no doubts that it's a paper I should look into with detail, can run it by professor Ana (in fact, probably will), but it's probably OK to keep it either way;
  * **Inclusion Criteria**
    * The title mentions "gamification" and "benefits"/"analysis"/"study" **together** or just the first term (we're making a software testing game, after all);
    * The title mentions "recent trends", "emerging trends", "growing trends" and other of the sort (state-of-the-art implies trends, so);
* **[HMM]**: returned by the query, immediately recognized as not directly going towards what I was hoping to find, but it intrigued me or I simply hope I can squeeze something good out of it because it interests me somehow;
  * **Inclusion Criteria**
    * Mentioning ChatGPT and its usage for software engineering - with explicit mention to software testing;
    * Mentioning other software engineering areas, such as requirements engineering - I took said class in year 4 and considering we're making a game/software, eliciting requirements is important;


### Exclusion Criteria
To note down any specific reasons to not include a paper.

* Not even indirectly related to software engineering or testing - for example, many papers seemed to be part of psychology studies and mentioned "mental health", though still included the term "testing";
* Application of software testing in very specific environments/industries, such as: online banking, a specific phone, etc...;
  * 2nd query on sciencedirect yielded some of these;
*


## Organization
I've decided to give up Google Docs considering it's recently been open for scraping for AI tools such as ChatGPT - thus, I've decided to try using Obsidian, which feels like it could very easily create a graphical visualization for the review.
