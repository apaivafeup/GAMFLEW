#Software_testing #Software_industry #Challenges 

* *[...] the level of joint industry-academia collaborations (IAC) in SE is very low, compared to the amount of activities in each of the two communities*
	* *This is especially the case for software testing*
* *The lack of mutual perception between industry and academia hurts both sides: researchers have fewer insights on the problems that are important to practitioners, while practitioners fail to learn what researchers have already discovered that might be useful to them.*
* *Many SE practitioners and researches and especially those in software testing are not talking to each other (adequately).*
	* Many reasons have been pointed out (paraphrased):
		* Different goals;
		* Industrial problems aren't scientifically innovative or challenging;
		* Academic solutions often don't consider their applicability and scalability in industry;
* *For the SE research community to have a meaningful future, there is a critical need to better connect industry and academia*
	* (paraphrased) The gap between both sides is even wider in software testing.
* The authors point out that academia often mentions that their conferences will bring practitioners and researchers together... which rarely is true;
	* Researchers and industry often focus on different issues;
		* Many papers point out that there is a big need for industrial empirical research in software testing
		* They prove this with a simple analysis of conference talks, industrial and academic.
			* They used word cloud visualization - there were some "matches", but they found they weren't really matches, as each side researched a given topic with different goals;
				* Automation: industry wants efficiency and automated test execution, academia wants automation in support of testing (like test-case design);
* **My own thoughts:** Academia tends to point many fingers at practitioners and the faults in their practices, often assuming a position of "corrector" rather than that of a teacher. It often also doesn't consider industry trends.
	* Academia assumes they're inherently right, which is easy to happen when many papers and talks are so thoroughly researched.
	* *Quotes:*
		* *researches in academia feel excited by 'theoretically challenging' issues, [...] while industrialist just want to find ways to improve effectiveness and efficiency of testing [...] without the need for 'fancy' methods or techniques which they mostly find to be too complicated and hard to implement and deploy in practice*;
		* *Model-based testing is quite popular in academia and seems to have a limited usage in some industry sectors, [...]* (and) *it has no widespread penetration in all industry sectors. Also mutation testing is widely discussed in research but has very low industrial penetration.*;
		* *[...] the two groups "live in two different worlds", since their areas of interest and focus, as the talk titles show, are quite different and we have seen that this is one main reason for low interaction among the two communities*;
	* Aka: it's important to take into consideration what students actually learn because we want them to learn things that are challenging and engaging but that prepare them for the future.
* *[...] many practitioners complain about low applicability and scalability of testing techniques proposed in most research papers. Further more, a lack of cost-benefit analysis in most research papers, i.e., how much effort/time has to be spent to adopt/implement a testing technique in a project and how much real cost savings will be yielded as a result, is highlighted as a major limitation of research ideas by practitioners.*
* *[...] the difference in writing formality by academics versus practitioners. Unfortunately, many practitioners believe that academic papers are too formal and hard to understand*.
	* *practitioners usually strive to write things in the simplest form possible*
	* It's important to make the tool accessible to students.
	* Another analysis is made and their expectation that academics use harder titles to read is met.
* Academia is more theory focused, industrial venues are more tutorial-based.
	* Topics are quite different.
	* Both areas need to work together to meet each other halfway.
		* My opinion: academia needs to work harder.
	* *Researches should focus on industry problems rather than abstract/artificial challenges, [...] and industrialist should value the research results and be open for IAC*;
	* *industrialists should raise sophisticated industrial challenges where solutions from research can be expected in discussions with researches or on special tracks of research conferences or workshops*
	* Authors advise using the Principles of Action Research (AR), especially when collaborating with industry;
	* *The research-intensive SE conferences [...] have to undertake more measures to become more interesting from the industry's perspective and to attract more practitioners.*
	* My opinion: academia thinks its better by default/inherently better, once again, they have research behind them, I guess.
* *practitioners and researchers are focusing on quite different things in testing. Having different focus areas is a major reason which leads to (very) low relative IAC in software testing, and also other areas of software engineering, in almost every country (the authors have had first-hand experience in Canada, Turkey and Austria).*
* *Effort is needed from both sides to increase the level of joint collaborations and to ensure win-win situations for both sides. Researchers should also be aware of the challenges of their industrial partners, and choose problems and topics that are novel, feasible, industrially relevant, and potentially impactful*.
