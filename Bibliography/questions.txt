- How specific should I make the queries? As specific as I want.
- How important is that I make the most broad query possible? A bit important, but we can make it very specific to control the amount of results, exclude as much as we can, and from the final selection go a little bit broadr via the references (a paper that is commonly referenced, for example).
- When should I stop, what is the document limit and how in depth should I go with reading? 100, in total, is feasible.
